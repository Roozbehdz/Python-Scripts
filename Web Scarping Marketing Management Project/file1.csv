I’m not huge on ride share or using anything that involves giving my bank info to a company. When using Uber for the first time I was very surprised at how competitive the prices were. Getting a ride from the casino was 79$ from a taxi and 36$ from Uber! I was shocked. The drivers are cool and do there best to make sure I was comfortable. The only bad part is the lack of rewards we can get and the discounts are only temporary and they’re given when they want to give add them to our account. And they come with restrictions. They combined it with Uber eats but they don’t offer it in my area which is a disappointment for sure. 
I’m very happy though they have Uber gift cards which allows me to not use a bank account and comes handy cause you never know when you could get stranded as we all at some point in our lives. I’ve had no bad experiences so far. Just make sure you grab everything before you leave the car as they really don’t look to see if you left anything behind. I’ve found many things left by prior customers and know how frustrating it can be.

I do not have Uber in the area where I live. But I use it whenever I travel in Mexico and the US. The worst experience I've had, in my 2 years of using Uber, was in San Francisco. I waited 14 minutes for a driver who didn't show up. He somehow canceled and went elsewhere, and I found out the hard way. It was annoying, but didn't cost me anything but my time. The overwhelming majority of times I have used Uber were great. Nice drivers who showed up on time, drove safely and gave great service. Most Uber drivers go above and beyond. They are happy to give travel tips to tourists and help with luggage. I always feel safe with Uber as I have the Uber car's description and license tag, plus a picture of the driver."

I’ve never used Lyft before, and the only cab company is highly ineffective. Uber, oddly enough, has attracted highly qualified, a very polite, drivers who drive Uber to earn extra money. I enjoy that scheduling a ride is simple through a smartphone application. Once Uber detects the local drivers, via GPS, it directs the closest driver who’s available and provides an estimated time to wait, and an estimated time a arrival to your destination. Uber also allows users to estimate the cost of rides in advance. Also, Uber allows the rider to tip directly from the application and also rate the driver. I’ve never had an issue with any Uber driver I’ve used. It’s more uncommon for me now, but every so often I do use Uber."

I've never had a negative experience with Uber. It was the one I downloaded first while in college and the one I've continue to use these past 3 or so years. Some experiences have been better than others but in my opinion the drivers probably have had a worse experience. The rides I've enjoyed the most were the ones when myself and the driver have respected each other's privacy, acted courteously and professional. I have witnessed people trash and throw up all over a driver's car, and that's not alright. I think the thing that has begun to creep into the way I view Uber is all of its negative publicity. Why would I support an enterprise that I don't agree with? It's not like I am dependent on Uber. I can use other ridesharing apps, I can use a traditional taxi, I can even use public transportation. Despite all of this, I still use Uber but that might not always be the case."

I have always been skeptical about rideshare services because of the news reports of assaults and robberies. I used this company for the first time earlier this year during a trip for a conference in Las Vegas. My first ride was excellent and was completed without a problem. My second ride was a little scary. I requested a ride but then my phone died. I was with a friend. While I was trying to recharge my phone, my friend came to me to tell me that our ride had arrived As we got in the car, I had an uneasy feeling. I started asking the driver ""who"" he was there to pick up and if he knew where we were going. He never gave me a straight answer and my friend had already told him where we were going. 
My suspicions were confirmed when the driver rolled down his window to yell out to a group of women who appeared to be streetwalkers. Also, when we arrived at our hotel, he quoted a price higher than the Uber app quoted. I was subsequently charged a ""missed ride"" fee by Uber because their showed to get us after we had left with the ""imposter"". I explained what happened to the customer service rep and they kindly changed their fee to a credit towards my next ride.

This happened on 02/06/2020 - So the car I drive has been having some issues and I needed to drop it off at my local Burt Brothers. I didn't have a way to get back home so I thought I would use an Uber gift card I got from my work to help me get home. Oh, I WISH I had gone with Lyft. Issue number one - Uber's navigation decided to go out so I had to be ""Siri"" and guide my driver to my home (not a huge issue since it wasn't too far away). Issue number 2 - I go to give my driver a tip and rate him and again, Uber systems are down and acting crazy. Issue number 3 - For an 8.5-mile drive, I got charged $33.00 when it should have been $15.00 (thank GOD I used a gift card and not a debit card!)
Issue number 4 - WHAT COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE A CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER OR AT LEAST A CHAT?!?! I had to get hold of someone (probably a robot) via Twitter!! Then when I try to communicate with them through email all I get are replies like ""We apologize for the issue you’re seeing. This is a known issue and our team is actively working to resolve it. We appreciate your patience as we work on this and can provide additional details as they become available."" So Uber doesn't even know WHY they're double charging their customers?! My advice? Either get Lyft, phone a friend, walk, ANYTHING but Uber.

I have only rode with Uber a couple of times and it has been one of my worse experiences. I scheduled a pick up with a driver and before exiting his vehicle I asked if he could wait on me to pick up a few items in the store, he said no problem. He said, ""You will have to cancel my pick up and once you reschedule since I am already here the call will be directed to me."" Not knowing any better, I did as I was instructed. Well that trip turned out to be a nightmare. I schedule another driver as instructed and got two other drivers trying to get the pick up, so the first says just cancel the pick up, well guess what. Once you cancel a pick up that's an automatic charge.
I contacted the second driver and he said, ""Well once you schedule another driver it's charged and I don't have anything to do with that."" The third driver said, ""You will have to cancel the trip and call Uber and they will give you a credit."" Well guess what. I contacted Uber and they politely give me a credit for the cancellation and then the next day reversed the charge and refuses to respond to my complaints about the situation.
What can you say other than poor service and charging customers for incorrect information giving by your drivers. As a business that does not train their driver to be on the same page, you should do the right thing and take of your customers and treat them as they matter, because pretty easy to communicate with other about your experience and the normally people don't tend to forgot. Honestly, I feel as a company that is trying to expand more and more, it doesn't take much to fail due to the lack of poor business. As many complaint that Uber have it going to be a company eventually that will fail due to poor business decisions and mistreating customers.

If I could give no stars- I would. UBER and customer support a zero. UBER charged more than what I was quoted. The map Uber gives their driver from the pier to Long Beach Airport was wrong. No airplanes in site following the UBER directions. We were going in circles. I finally pulled out my maps TO direct driver to correct location. Obviously UBER directs their drivers to the wrong location all the time. The address is a commercial business not LONG BEACH AIRPORT. The business made a commercial sign to tell UBER drivers this is not the LONG BEACH AIRPORT.??? It appears UBER is charging me an additional fare to go around in circles. It's a good thing I requested a ride hours before my flight. And all the agents in customer support are donkeys. How hard is it to understand what I just said. They have not adjusted my fare."

Not only worst customer service... there is NO customer service available and NO ONE to contact. I took 3 rides on 2/1/20. My account shows 3 rides that I actually took 3 rides totaling charges $43.54 with tips. Verified in my trips on the app. My bank account is being charged a different amount of $62.23. That's $18.69 they didn't earn. The worst part is the app sucks with NO way to contact anyone for resolution. I am contacting my bank tomorrow and filing chargebacks. In addition, I'm moving my biz to Lyft from now on. It appears it's all set up, so they can screw potentially thousands of people out of small amounts they may not notice and stick in Uber's pocket. IMHO it's thievery. Filing a BBB complaint."

As a university professor there is little problem dropping me at the garage structure near my office, But returning home is a terrible problem. The pickup point does not show for the Uber driver and even when talking with him or her on the phone as s/he make her way slows the process considerably. Yesterday, the driver, a nice man, was 20 minutes late as I waited in the cold, delivered me to an incorrect address, then was surprised when I gave him my home address far away because he had no record of it. 
The expense was more than double what it should have been. Then adding insult to injury Uber charged me for a cancelled trip which I never made or cancelled. Trying to get to Uber to rectify these probs was wending my way through an algorithm labyrinth. For the sake of customer service, Uber must devise a quicker and more civilized way of responding to inadequate, overcharged service. Uber's faults wherever I can online. I will continue to broadcast Uber's problems online.

On January 18, 2020, I made a ½ hour trip with Uber near Quito, Ecuador. The agreed fee was $ 8.95. The same night, Uber charged me $71.58 on my Visa card. The email receipt showed a map with a trip I did not take. It appears that my driver, Franklin **, continued driving and charged me for the extra trip. When I contacted Uber (submitting all the details as requested in the app), they deleted my account, saying they had detected some irregularities. I have been trying for days to resolve this issue, including attempts to reactivate my account, but the app won’t let me. I continue to get the same automated responses by email, directing me to use the app (which I can't do). There is no phone number, so I have no recourse to getting a refund. Although in this case it appears the driver was fraudulent, it is unacceptable that Uber provides no method for resolving the issue. BEWARE OF UBER. I will probably never use them again."

I took a airport to airport from my hotel in Las WBA’s. The amount said I will be charged $14 plus some change. When the Uber arrived I informed the driver that I am taking domestic flight and want to go to domestic terminal. The driver said, ""I don’t speak English."" I kept telling him I want to go to domestic. He kept saying, ""Okay okay."" Finally when he took a turn I realized he was taking me to the international terminaI. I said, ""This is the wrong terminal."" He pulled over and pulled over his phone and asked me to talk into his phone translator. This he did after driving for 20 minutes and not listening to me. I even mentioned the name of the airline went I first enter the car. Did not understood a word of English and in spite of complaining to the Uber customer service they still charged twice as much.

I used this company yesterday for 1st time. Ok but driver had an attitude about where I sat and the distance. Today I was watching the app to see where he was - right at the time I expected him to drive in the drive - it said cancelled. I had to be at work very soon. I do not like to drive or walk in this snowy, icy weather so I called them. I had to drive to work - walk across icy parking lot - at the last minute. And then they charge me a stupid fee because he traveled a distance. The addresses listed were not even the right ones. I got an Uber credit - now why would I want to use this company again!!!! I am a Sr Citizen - my money is tight and I need a refund on my card not a credit. What a bunch of crap!!!"

Uber drivers see my name and cancel rides all the time. I am a ** female. I don’t have a criminal background and I worked for Uber for some time about a year ago until I sold everything and moved to another city to continue my education. I have had rides cancel on me while I’m waiting for them to arrive. After Uber says they are en route to me. Here is where it gets really crazy. On top of that Uber charged me each time 5.00 for a cancellation fee. That the drivers canceled on me. I really read all about statistics showing that drivers are 4 time more likely to cancel rides with a person with a name that sounds like an ** name and so forth so I know this is the case. However, I find this so disheartening that Uber who knows it is people of all races keeping this business thriving is allowing this and topping it off with charging a 5.00 cancellation fee after you have been discriminated against. 
Today I disputed all of the past charges because when you're in a rush and trying to get somewhere you tend to forget and move on but I sorted everything out and asked Uber if they would like to refund my money in full because I didn’t cancel the rides and Uber only paid for one ride when there were quite a few 7.00 rides and the drivers canceled and they refunded me 2 dollars and kept the rest. Unbelievable and a smack in the face on top of the discrimination and I just want everyone out there to know what they are doing. If you know anything about the law or plan a class action lawsuit Please include me. I would like to be a voice to stop this business.

I reached out to Uber a couple times through their side menu ""Help"" in order to request a refund when I was overcharged for a trip. Unfortunately, it's very hard to get in touch with an agent, as they don't send emails to verify they've received the message. I had to keep checking in with the app, looking up ""Help"" and ""Messages"" to see if they'd replied. In the end, I had to get in touch with my credit card company to verify the refund. It would be much better if customers could have a more straightforward feedback channel. A call line would be even better.

In New York city we went from under 6000 cabs to over 136000. Most unreliable service. People are losing jobs, custody and money paid for congestion fees, congestion created by the high number of cabs on the same infrastructure we had 100 years ago. Drivers are not able to drive, shower or understanding English in most of the situations. They are always late, if they show up to pick you up, and have an attitude if you bring it up in any shape or form. Uber doesn't have a customer service as they don't care much as long as the stream of cash keeps coming in. I personally started writing to my legislators and the City Hall offices.

I ride almost always with Uber because they has good prices, constantly has promotions and the most important thing is that they care for your safety. I’ve had situations with drivers that turns aggressive to other drivers or that they gets mad for requests you make them, even though that’s established within the fares, and once you contact the customer service team they immediately take notes on the matter and compensates you in any way or the other. Also, if you have an issue during your trip, they provides you with tools to get emergency assistance wherever you are."

Both drivers were safe drivers, their cars were clean and comfortable, and they readily adjusted their thermostat in their car to accommodate our comfort level. The second driver that picked us up from the concert was able to get very close to the arena exit doors. We did not have to walk very far at all to get to his car after the concert.

I've been using Uber for 10 years..when it began in SF, Ca. I used it in NYC, NJ and now Los Angeles, CA. I cannot drive due to my disability and before uber I had to live in cities with great mass transit like SF and NYC. But because of Uber and their amazing cost (comparison to a car) concern of their riders/drivers...I am available to live anywhere in the world now. (Well almost!) I've met amazing drivers, people...and in my 10 years have only had 3 or 4 drivers I've had to make a report on their behavior. (It's like customer service...some people are just not made for it)."

I had not used Uber before and was staying at a hotel. I asked someone at the desk to help me order a ride for the next AM. That morning 6 Ubers showed up, all but one driver understood, 5 excused the order but 1 driver not only would not but was very ugly to me. My bank had to decline the charge as he would not. The next Am a wonderful driver came and helped me and I had a wonderful ride and great talks on my way."

The Uber driver and vehicle were as I would hope in public transportation. He took the most direct route and got me to my destination in the estimated time. My only frustration was not with Uber but rather the Sporting Venue I attended. They promoted the Uber/Lyft as a good option and a specific pick up and drop off location. However, they did not have any signage or directions to the Pickup/drop off point. I think the idea was great, execution poor. Maybe the UBER/LYFT companies could provide some signs for directions to spot to the venues."

I took an Uber to my home recently, while my car was being serviced. My criteria when rating a ride: Timeliness, Cleanliness, Vehicle Condition, Driver Navigation & Friendliness. All of these were met, & the driver was very pleasant as well. I gave him a ""5"" star review on Uber's app. (I also tipped him $4.00 on a $12.00 ride) On these merits, I'd definitely recommend taking Uber. However, I do have issues with Uber charging me two days later for a ride I didn't request, or take! I am requesting a refund, But still.... I shouldn't have to argue with Uber Reps when they're at fault."

1. Ride arrivals times are frequently changed. 2. Prices from airport is 3 times than home to airport 3. When traveling abroad, frequently Uber drives cancels the ride and I am penalized. It is very difficult to get charged reversed after 2 times. 4. It is very hard to get customer service on the phone. 5. If I cancel, I pay the penalty but if driver canceled the ride, there is no reimbursement or discount on substitute ride."

I am a part-time UberSelect Driver-Partner, working in Montreal. Recently, Uber made some changes to the categories of Rides, adding UberComfort and UberPremiere. I contacted the support through the app, to inquire how come my 2017 Audi A4, a luxury sedan, isn't eligible for those rides, especially since I have a nearly perfect score of 4.93 stars, and all I have been getting is the worst ever run-around, completely ignoring my requests to escalate to a Team Leader or a Supervisor or a Manager/Director in my area whom I can ACTUALLY SPEAK TO, and they keep copy-pasting replies that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. I guess they're all the way in India the support team, because they can't even comprehend basic English.
I find it ridiculous that they keep ignoring my request to escalate the matter. It's very frustrating, and it's been going on for 4-5 days now, with Deekshit and his colleagues at support doing the worst job ever to help me.

First, I picked UBER POOL as it was 40.00 cheaper than just UBER. I was given 89.00 for my complete fare on the app.. Which told me that was it. Didn't press anything else. THIS WAS THE COMPLETE PRICE THAT UBER put on my cell phone. The next day, I got a charge of 109.98, on my credit card. Plus I gave the driver cash tip. I DIDN'T approve any tip. They put an extra tip charge in addition to the 109.98. I was told that because I didn't take a picture of the day of service price, that it's my word against theirs. Basically calling me a liar. They now have a surcharge of LAX 4.50, 2.50 FOR PICK UP. Fee upon fee. Should have taken a taxi."

The best one was an immaculate SUV. It looked brand new even though it was about 7 years old. The driver was polite, cautious, very neatly dressed.

Uber is lifesaver in the greater DC metro area. Bethesda, Rockville area travel has become much better. I think Uber has benefited businesses along Rockville Pike. Now I can Uber and go to various restaurants and stores along the pike without having to wait inordinate amount of time for a cab or bus. And the drivers are always polite. I think free wifi along the greater DC area would be especially useful for businesses along the pike to invest in. This way tourists with no data plans can benefit from Uber and travel along the many stores and restaurants in that area."

As a driver you are always wanting to protect yourself by having a dash camera to present evidence for any allegation, I had to file a police report with the Philadelphia Uber hub Office for not submitting my - camera footage and even possibly performing negligence by using my - camera footage with my customers and myself in inappropriate ways. When traveling with any company such as even uber. When they have no way of protecting the customer or driver to reassure nothing happened that was illegal or immoral there is a security concern. 
As a driver I have dealt with children and elderly individuals who have told me about rideshare experiences and driver experiences that have not been documented or reported due to the drivers not having - camera footage and when they did have - camera footage copies were never released to them or uber. To protect your children your families as well as yourself do not get inside a rideshare without a Dash 7 camera. Even after you file a police report the driver will still maintain this status and till the company either deactivates the account or suspends it. 
I have contacted the New Jersey senators office for Morris County and even spoke to the Philadelphia Police Department regarding the actions that have been caused upon me as well as my customers while driving for this company and since there is a Gray area with rideshare there is no guarantee of protection that can be given immediately. In order to solve my matter where my information was stolen or even negligence was caused by the company I am now needing to go to court to resolve this period. Do not put yourself in this situation it just leads to heartache and a lack of faith in companies when they do not even regulate customers on the road whether they are sexual offenders or even individuals with restraining orders. I have documented even those with uber To no avail.

I have been with Uber for over 5 years now and I am a frequent user for work, personal and food rides. I also am rated at 4.83/5 which should tell you that I am not one to be rude or complain about every single bit, until now. Last night I took the uber pool due to the insane surge charge but I didn’t think my experience would be horrific. I live 1.7 miles away from my pick up spot which is roughly 10 minutes at most away. It took me 30 minutes to get home. If this was traffic I could understand but it was the unreasonable amount of pick up and out of the way route that caused all of this. 
Here’s how it went. I was picked up. We picked up passenger 1, dropped off passenger 1. Picked up passenger 2 & 3 (2 people) and just when it's about to turn to the street to my place, it rerouted to pick up passenger 4 (completely out of the way). How greedy can uber be? That’s a total of 5 people in 1 pool! And out of the route too. I went ahead and contacted customer support which gave me an auto prompted response of apologies but will refund the trip for this inconvenience. I will go ahead and dispute this charge and fight it out of principle. Uber is in a service industry - the customers should be your priority within reason of course. This has been nothing but disappointment. Greed is a bad business plan.

I had an accident with an Uber driver in Mexico City. The car that I got into had no side mirror. The Brakes were not working properly either. I almost got into an accident twice. The driver's conversation was unpleasant. Being a foreigner he was very curious to ask where I am from and what brought me to Mexico. I replied to be a tourist and thought that conversation is over. He became very rude and asked me if I came to look for a Mexican husband. I never answered and kept quiet. He took the wrong route and made several in requested stops. Having in mind it was uberX. He continued. Asked me whom I sleep with. He literally stopped the car and asked me to wait for him text someone. I asked him to let me go and take a different driver but he locked the doors and didn't allow me. 
When it came to dropping off he refused to drop me off to my location so I had to walk and it was raining. I wrote to the support team for help which was nothing but a disappointment. They wrote a note to tell me to thank you for providing the feedback. I ended up paying triple the booking amount and they even did not care or even address my issues.
This company is just concern about money. They do not care if you get injured, harassed or even killed provide you make them money. They have the worst support team in Mexico City in particular. Provided you can't text in Spanish they do not care. Avoid this driver in Mexico. Regular taxis are very professional nay have a reliable support team. This a million-dollar company that has no concern of customers welfare just Dollar.

In July of this year I had sushi delivered to me in Mexico by UberEats, a subsidiary of Uber, on five occasions. The total cost was 1,918 pesos -- about $100 US. However, I was billed $1,919 dollars(!) on my credit card; something I discovered at the end of the month when paying my credit cards. I contacted Uber Customer Support (Uber does not provide any number to call, so all customer service work has to be through the via email messaging) and I was told that, due this was a glitch in the app and my charges would be refunded.
However, no refund materialized for several weeks, despite numerous emails. It should be noted that, whenever one replies to an email from Uber Support the person reading your reply appears to be different each time, and completely unaware of the history of the exchange, as their response to you does not even include a copy of what you previously wrote (go figure!). So, they are in fact starting from scratch each time, and as a result the correspondence just goes around in circles. In my case, all that happened is that I got the same pro-forma responses, each time from a different person, that ""our team is working on your issue; sorry for the inconvenience"" and ""we are debiting your credit card ending in ##"" even though no debit ever appeared. 
After a month and a half of this pointless back-and-forth, I had no option but to appeal the charges at my credit card company, sending the card company all the correspondence including Uber's admission in those emails that this was an error in the software and assurances that my card was being debited (even though it never was). During the subsequent month or so the credit card company investigated the issue, and eventually found in my favor.
As the error had been in the UberEats app and not the Uber app for rides, I continued to use Uber for rides until, just recently, my account was ""suspended."" So, once again, as there is no number to call, I had to begin the process of email communication through Customer Support. And once again, the communication went around in circles; the first response saying that my account was suspended due to an outstanding charge of the original 1,918 pesos, but when I replied to that one authorizing payment for that amount, I received another response (from a different person) stating that my account was suspended ""for security reasons"" due to an ""ongoing dispute"" I had initiated with my credit card company and that I would need to end the dispute before my account could be reactivated. 
When I replied stating that the dispute had in fact been terminated in my favor, and providing all the details of the currency mix up, I again received the same first response (from yet another person) that there was an unpaid outstanding debt outstanding debt of 1,918 pesos, and my reply to that, again authorizing the payment, resulted in the exact same ""version 2"" response, by a fourth person, stating that, for ""security reasons"" etc etc. So, I give up; luckily there are alternatives to Uber.

When the service worked, it was good, and tech support responds quickly most of the time. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the problems I encountered. The app rejected my credit card and offered no explanation as to why. For some reason it accepted my PayPal even though it uses the very card the app had just rejected. It took days of back and forth with tech support to find out that my card ""isn't compatible with their system"", but they refused to be more specific than that and no matter how many times I asked what the exact problem was (ie my bank, the type of card, etc) all they did was rephrase the same answer over and over again with canned responses; repeatedly telling me to check w/ my bank, even after I told them I already had done so.
I would have tried a different card, but if they won't tell me which cards they don't like. I might have just ended up w/ the same problem. After 5 days of using my PayPal account without any issues, suddenly at 1:30am 25 miles from home the service decided that it wouldn't accept my PayPal account either and I was stranded. 
naturally, tech support told me to contact paypal. when I contacted PayPal, they told me my account was in good standing and that no requests from Uber had even come through to them. Just like what happened when I contacted my bank about my credit card. When I tried to cancel my account through the website it told me either that my account was ""temporarily disabled"" or that I had the wrong password. Again, I had to contact tech support and to their credit they were able to quickly link me to the password reset page to change my password which was ""wrong."" Then finally I was able to cancel my account. Next time I'll just deal w/ the stress of driving and parking in a busy urban area, knowing at least that when the day is over I can get home again.

Being a responsible driver, I made the decision to use Uber after a few drinks at a local cantina. My friends and I live within a couple miles of each other, so we shared the Uber. I was the second person to be dropped off and my sole set of keys (i.e. car, house, storage, work) fell out of my pocket. I realized I had left them in the backseat almost immediately, but had no way to contact the driver bc, unfortunately, my friend was the one who ordered the ride. My friend contacted him the next day (that was a feat within itself bc Uber drivers are extremely protected), but did not receive a response.
Over the course of one week (no access to vehicle still parked at restaurant, cannot lock my house, cannot access my storage), multiple attempts to reach the driver, and several back and forth email discussions with Uber (in which they charged $15 just to have the discussion - I know, completely ridiculous, right? But welcome to our money hungry 2019 society), no one can seem to locate our driver. While Uber responded in a quick manner, they weren't helpful and continued to reiterate that their policy notes that they ""are not responsible for lost items"". Yeah, that might be understandable for a sweater or article of clothing, but that excuse doesn't fly for my only set of keys to access my life.
They ultimately backed out of helping and suggested I open a police report with my local police department (so let's make this a huge headache when it doesn't have to be). They also have no way of locating their 'employee', which concerns me even more. What if there was a major issue on my trip that required his input? And on the other spectrum..Is he okay? Why are they unable to locate him? How can an employer fail to locate their employee? How can a customer issue go unresolved?
Now someone I don't know has access to my home. office, and car. He knows where I live because he dropped me off, and he could access my car at any time. While he seemed like a nice man and I in no way want to assume otherwise, it's not right for Uber to simply disregard this issue as if it's low priority. Now I've spent $500 (!!!) to have a new car key made and have had to replace my home and work locks (costing me additional $$). I admit that I have to take responsibility to some extent for the fact that I left my keys, but it's poor business practice for Uber to wave this away as if they have zero responsibility whatsoever.
If the driver responded and said there's a fee associated with the return, then so be it. But the fact that NO ONE can locate him should put more pressure on Uber to resolve this...not simply pawn this off on the local PD (whom don't have this as a high priority either). So the end result is that the driver is protected, the rider is not, and my home/car/business/storage are at risk to anyone who has my keys. Needless to say, I will NEVER use Uber again. Which is unfortunate for them because we have provided a lot of $$ to them through personal and business use.

I tried reaching the customer more than once and sat through the app provided timer for 8 minutes waiting on some direction from customer which I never got. At the end of that time I was allowed to end the delivery, so I did. This customer waited 3 hours or so and ordered food again from a different restaurant. Guess who got that delivery? Same thing as before, can't access the building, customer won't answer my calls, wait for 8 minutes, end delivery. Then there was he 2 Orders from Steak and Shake. 
I arrived to find they were not prepared yet, so I sat down to wait. About 25 minutes pass, and the number of people waiting has grown, All of the sudden I hear loud voices and realize that one of the guest has gone into the food prep area and began shouting at a cook, who is shouting back. Several onlookers have began filming with their phones in apparent amusement. I am growing uneasy as all of this is unfolding and remember the warning I received two days before about deliveries taking longer than expected. 
I excuse myself and go call support to make sure that continuing to wait is advised. It is not, support makes the deduction to cancel both orders. And compensates me a whole 5 dollars for my time and gas and trouble. Not a problem though, not until the next day when I am told in-app that I suspected of fraudulent activity and that my instant pay privelges are revoked. I can still deliver but I can't be paid up to 5 times daily as before. I must now wait for the one day a week direct deposit. 
When you put 30 dollars a day in the gas tank to be able to do your job, and now can't recover the same day to do it all again the next day, you might as well deactivate my account. I have reached out multiple times to try and resolve this but no one will talk to me about it. All I've gotten is if there are no more incomplete deliveries for two months they will consider giving me back my privelges of instant pay. Well guess what? If I can't recover what I put in the gas tank every day then I can't make deliveries, so there won't be any deliveries period. Does that count? I certainly hope so. 
I have never in my life had such an experience. How can you punish me for something that I had no control over? I did everything right in my opinion and since you won't even address these issues with me then I guess you agree. I worked 12 hours a day for the three weeks I was online with Ubereats and made close to 200 deliveries with very high ratings. But I am suspected of fraud for what? This should be illegal.

Upfront pricing not true pricing. Uber pads the bill so much. I've had Uber drivers charge for wait time when they are parked down from my house and I am out on my front porch waiting and watching them. Booking fee $3.05 come on! Toll and surcharges plus time and distance charges. Now they are dropping me off a few blocks from my destination saying they got to take another call. Uber drivers that I have used have showed up at my house wanting a hookup. One driver started groping me on my front porch. Uber customer service is a brick wall. Credited me $3.00 on a ride on Uber Cash. No matter what they do or charge they have an excuse and they are right. When I reported the sexual harassment of the two drivers they suspended my account. They cost more than a taxi and a taxi never has told me to get out and walk the rest of the way. 
I am in my 60s, a widow, and live alone. Uber can suck it. Taxis for me. I frigging hate Uber. Scam artists. One Uber driver's car was over 20 years old. No air conditioning, universal joint roaring, rap screaming and he was smoking no seat belts. I've had drivers unfamiliar with area nor could they read GPS instructions. I have also had great drivers and exceptional service. I feel bad for them but Uber needs to not exist. They do suck.

Drive with Uber you need to get better. I currently drive for Uber but am concerned with some drivers taking advantage of people with disabilities. I had picked up a Uber customer who had a 3 star rating, which to me I thought there was something wrong but still decided to accept the ride. When I picked up the gentleman I realized he was blind. As he got in my car we had a conversation and he told me that I was the quickest pick up he has ever gotten and asked me why. He told me he usually has to keep requesting Ubers over and over. I know why. It’s because the drivers are declining a 3 star rider. I told him it was because I don’t pass up any opportunities to pick people up to get them to their destination. He was the most kindest man I have ever met and I realized that other drivers have given him low ratings just because he had a disability.
It hurts me to think that UBER AS A COMPANY CONDONES AN ACT LIKE THIS. Which tells me a lot about the drivers that we have working for Uber. A billion dollar company needs to step up to the plate and do something about that. Our customers do not choose to have a disability. Unfortunately I know that a billion dollar company will do nothing about it so I will. I will make sure that people with disabilities will be heard!!!! Uber will hire anybody and they don’t care!!!! Friends if you have a family member that has a disability would you still use a company who does not care about people with disabilities???

I ordered myself for a ride about 10 blocks away from my home to a restaurant knowing I would be consuming alcohol. They offered me a discounted ride to walk to the corner of my block for pickup. I agreed to that. Once I confirmed my ride, I was notified I would be dropped off about 4 blocks away from the restaurant. I never agreed to that. That part was not advertised. That area is unsafe being is next to a highway ramp with no crosswalks or traffic signals to get to my destination. So I immediately canceled the ride. 
The total for the ride was about 6 or 7 dollars initially. I saw a $0.00 charge for cancellation. NOW TODAY the NEXT DAY I received a CANCELATION FEE for $5.00 plus sales tax $0.44 a TOTAL of $5.44. I requested a dispute and they gave me an uber credit. I do not want an uber credit. I want my cash back into my bank account. I called numbers they keep telling me there is nobody I can speak to and that they resolved the issue. And THEY DID NOT RESOLVE the ISSUE. They charged me for 1 MINUTE!

Uber one minute gave me a quote of $50 on a ride I needed. A kind family member helped me to pay for it by purchasing an Uber gift card for me. As soon as I loaded the gift card onto my account, I brought the same ride up in app--and now, not 10 minutes later, it showed $63! Just to see if this was due to surge pricing, I tried the same ride in Lyft. It was $50--the same price Uber had quoted me before I loaded the Uber gift card.
When I attempted to dispute this online/in the app, the ""Help"" page/section was utterly confusing and useless. None of the clickable options on the help page described my issue, and the only number for Uber you can call is an ""emergencies only"" number. They literally have zero live customer service. So, I emailed my concern to Uber customer service. Three different responders pretended to be concerned about my query, but provided nothing but copied text from a ""how to respond to customers"" FAQ. They would not even acknowledge my gouging complaint and made me feel like I was to blame. I will never use Uber again! Worthless, terrible customer ""service."" No wonder that bloated joke of a company remains unprofitable despite treating their drivers like slaves.

9/24/2019 Uber just updated its App. In the past, I was able to save between $6 to $8 per rider to share the pool, at the present with new Uber App, the company only cares to “maximize” its profit, yet disregard the benefit to the riders. I called the Uber via iPhone, and decided to save few dollars to join the pool rider. You could say it was my own doing that there was only two dollars difference between ride alone of $32.82 and pool rider of $30.84 (already added $2.71 for point to point pickup/drop). So around 14:07 Uber picked me up and drove around blocks, picked up another rider, dropped her off at Target, and picked up another passenger at MGM. I was all over places to save two dollars since Uber changed it App."

I have used Uber for a number of years. My recent experience has made me question that. I was erroneously charged a sum of money on my journey to cover the driver using airport parking and picking me up from the airport - he did not use airport parking (at least with no need to collect me) and he did not pick me up from the airport! I have raised this through tens and tens of messages going backwards and forwards to uber, but they just won't listen, keep taking the same party lines and have more or less told me to go away. I asked for the CEO's details to complain to, but they have not and will not provide me with them. The sum I was refunding is meager, but it is the principal!

It looks like Uber has not been able to resolve the data breach issues they have and when confronted with evidence of a customer having unauthorized charges on her credit card from a foreign country, they choose to dismiss it and leave the burden of resolving the problem on the customer, instead of addressing and solving it, as a responsible and customer oriented company would do. Therefore, if you don't want your credit card to be used by foreign riders around the world, it looks like the best option you have as a customer is to resolve it yourself and close the Uber account (since Uber clearly won't resolve the issue)."

So I take Uber pool service to office every day. It has been more than two years now. I have had normal experiences as well as extremely bad ones. Now, recently, in the past one month Uber services has becoming so pathetic that it is crossing all limits. Firstly, I do not get cabs at all, even by luck if I do, the route is such that it takes me a lot of time to reach. Well, that is still acceptable given that pool cabs are supposed to be like that. Half an hour or 45 mins extra is okay with me.
However, for the past few days I had to wait patiently for around 1 to 1.5 hours to drop off a co-rider and reach my destination. I take the cab in the morning around 6:30 to 6:40 am when there is not much traffic on the road, not a considerable amount that can be taken into account. So, my suggestion to fellow people is that if you have to reach office or any place in emergency, please avoid Uber. It is better to take other modes of transport or cab facilities.

I was visiting DC and am not familiar with the city. I had been doing tour sites for work and ended up near my hotel having dinner with co-workers. I did not realize how close I was to my hotel but because it was late, as a woman I did not want to walk alone so I ordered an Uber. The driver was going to take full advantage of me. He was charging me $14... I accepted it because I thought I was probably far from my hotel. When he started to drive, and as we approached the traffic light at the end of the street (the restaurant was located in the middle of that street) I recognized the Walgreens and Starbucks on the corner and realized the restaurant I had been eating at was not even a 1/4 of a block away.
Well the driver should have turned right on that red light, when I saw he did not, I told him he had passed my hotel, I told him to stop, which he did not and I had to ask him several times to stop and he did not stop until he got to the end of the following street. I had to now walk a lot further than what I would have walked had I never ordered UBER. And UBER still charged me $14. When I complained they only offered to reimburse me $3. In the past, UBER used to regulate their drivers. I have had drivers try to take advantage of me in the past and UBER would change the charge accordingly due to the driver taking a poor route. Now they just want to give you a $3 credit for a ride that should have only cost me at most $5 (minimum charge). The fact that UBER is no longer regulating their drivers is completely unacceptable. Drivers will take advantage of tourists, as this one clearly tried to do to me.

I booked Uber drive wherein the driver who accepted my request was already on a trip which would have taken roughly 20-25 mins to complete.

I told him I would not do so as I was not liable to pay the cancellation charges for his mistake and when I insisted him to cancel the trip he started shouting and saying ""ek baar bola hua samajh nai aaya kya? Kisika noukar nai hoo 10 lakh ki gadi leke ghumta hoo"".

Uber lies, cheat, steals, cons, tricks drivers. They kept dropping the pay from 1.80 a mile last year to 70 cents. That is on average. They do not even pay for gas while they charge Customers a minimum of $7.00 and pay driver $3.00. Driver pays gas costs. Drivers went from wondering if they are ripping you off. To them telling you the $3.00 dollar is an error in the system. But 1 year later, they still do the same thing. But now, it has all changed: Uber is now blatantly criminally robbing drivers.

10) Uber takes 40% to 70% now, and pays zero gas costs!
Companies like Uber who come to America to cheat, rob, Con, lie, rob, steal, and bankrupt Americans should be dealt With like they are domestic terrorists.

After a concert in the Woodlands Tx, we were headed to downtown Houston to another address. During the trip one of our passengers became ill so we decided to call it a night instead. The driver asked me to change the address in the app. I did as asked. The new address was 4 miles closer than the original destination. I was charged an almost $90 surcharge for changing the address of the trip and the driver never stated that would happen. I even tipped her $15 for the night. I contacted Uber the next day by email. I received one email back that they'd look I to it and haven't heard back since. Their Customer Service is TERRIBLE. I have asked for a refund and I still haven't received any word back at all since this happened at the beginning of July. Almost 2 months."

I booked an Uber Ride in Geneva, Switzerland on 8/24/19. The ride did not show up at the address I specified. I was charged a cancellation fee. I ordered another Uber Ride and again they did not show at the address indicated. I was charged another cancellation fee. I made one final attempt and this time they got it right. I felt the drivers in Switzerland were horrible compared with my positive experiences in the US. I would highly recommend not using the Uber service internationally. I filed a complaint about the cancellation charges and they indicated that my credit card would be refunded on 8/25/19.
On 8/26/19 I noticed that my credit card had not been refunded so I logged on to their site only for them to indicate that my credit card had already been refunded. As of 8/28/19 it has still not been credited. I know that it may take time to process the refund, but they had indicated that it had already been refunded to my credit card. I feel that they just told me they had refunded my money to shut me up. I have filed numerous complaints on their automated site, but have yet to hear back from a live person.

The driver was young and naive looking. He was almost like a robot w/ no emotions. Every time I asked for help he would just say ""I don't know how to do that,"" or ""I'm not sure,"" JUST like the Echo Dot devices! He didn't care about where he was kicking me to the curb, didn't care that I didn't know how to use their app, didn't care that I lived. I'm SO glad I scheduled to drop off my daughter at school first, so she wasn't there to witness her scared mom, at a gas station, with no ride home. I tried to figure out how to use the app to get customer support too, but there was none! I even told the driver that I had cash on me and I can pay him. He just said ""If it's not in the app then I can't take you."" Uber driver was not customer friendly."

I have no complaint with my drivers. It's ""Uber"" in general that I have issues with. Based on my new and recent experience with Uber out of Jersey City/New York City. Changes in upfront price given, wasn't given a reason and no reason would even make sense. The arrival time was exactly as quoted with no changes in route. Only a few areas of congestion on the 45 minute long ride, overall easy ride. So why significant extra change?!...And then when I tried to find this out through Uber online support they charged my credit card almost 5 dollars each time (for a total of 25 dollars)! That's ridiculous and bad business practice. And for the 5 dollars I was not able to even send my complaint or receive any answer. 
Once home I took my credit card off the Uber account and no surprisingly, my issue that I wrote out clearly will no submit. So to get help, I will need to pay 5 dollars and each time no answer! And of course there is no other way to reach Uber outside of this for paying customers. This is unethical and a business will clearly eventually go under. I feel bad for the drivers that work for this company. My advice do not use Uber, because if an issue occurs, you will not get an answer or a resolution with paying big!

I ordered an Uber home with one additional stop to pick up some food, as he dropped me off to pick up the food I told him I would be right back and he said ok, when I got my food and came outside he was gone without a trace and upon checking my phone it said the trip was complete. I paid $17 for this trip and he did not take me home. Instead he robbed me and I was left stranded outside without any money to order another ride.
This company also has terrible terrible support contact center employees, their contact help center is almost exclusively based in the Philippines probably because their labor is much cheaper than American employees, but these Pinoys do not even speak proper English and oftentimes act like robots or machines when handling your problems and hardly ever get your problem resolved immediately, it's sad that a company like Uber that makes billions only cares about money and so will not spend a few extra dollars on QUALIFIED employees to handle to help center.

Don't expect Uber to show any care/concern for you, even if you are a long-time customer with a disability. My husband and I were both screwed over by customer service over things that were clearly Uber's fault. A couple of weeks ago, my husband was denied a promotion for a week because Uber ADMITTED that there is a lag in their system, and it didn't update in time for him to take advantage of the promotion. Even though customer service admitted it, they refused to credit him in any way and just said too bad!
Same thing with me. I just had an issue with Uber Eats where part of my order literally disappeared during placement, and I wasted a half-off promotion on 2 little sides of ranch dressing. After placing the 2nd order to get the rest of my food that disappeared, I called customer service to see about getting reimbursed, and they basically said too bad!! They are so greedy, and they have no intention of helping their customers. Too bad for them that they are not the only people in town. My husband and I plan on canceling our accounts and switching to Lyft and Postmates from now on. SCREW YOU UBER, JUST LIKE YOU SCREW EVERYONE ELSE!!

Please all consumers to check your Uber charge one-two days after, as I was charged 20 times more than what I agreed for my share ride of a few blocks in NYC, without being informed or even not being aware. On 30 July 2019, I took a share ride in NYC and was dropped off six minutes later. I was sitting just behind a driver and a co-rider was next to me. Although I was not happy about the driver's pick up (he passed me few blocks), his route (deviation), and his drop off (needed to get off very busy car traffic side), I did not complain as I thought it was a short ride. 
Usually I don't check the fare once I finished my ride. But due to a credit card statement check I need to do, I found that Uber charged $73.40 for the upfront fare of 3.40 (20 times more). I contacted Uber for explanations, and after two complaints, they sent a photo of a right hand side seat with a slight water leakage over rubber mat. I did not create any mess or I was not sitting in the right side, and the photo taken time was not at 16:28 when I got off, I complained for false accusation. Uber denied twice but I asked how they investigated and charged, they acted to refund partially the original charge of the ride. 
I of course requested a full disclosure of the investigation process, and formal apologies from the company and the driver, and compensations of my time loss and moral damages to deal with the issue over 2-days. Uber did not respond to my requests, and defending their position to hear only from the driver and charge automatically to customers for any fees the drivers claimed. This is wrong business practice and should be corrected. For consumers, beware UBER charge always, and you may review past charges and you may find errors and false accusations like mine. I was very shocked and contact with consumer bureaus.

Web booked Uber today to take us from Reagan Airport in Washington, DC to our home in Chevy Chase, MD, a trip that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes. Uber knows our address well. It routinely picks us up there and returns us there. From the airport, however, the driver set out upon roads we had never seen. We assumed he was avoiding congestion or knew a route to our home that we did not. After nearly an hour we noticed that we were navigating Hyattsville, MD, which is about an hour west of Chevy Chase. We opened Google maps, and he used that, along with shortcuts we suggested to our home. What might have been a one-hour trip home, in view of rush hour traffic then, took at least two. The driver was patient and courteous, and the fault might have been Uber’s navigation system, not his."

I reached customer support and after a few email exchanges, customer support sent me a rude (and offensive) email that I have violated the terms and conditions. I can safely say that this is truth challenged. I have no duplicate accounts, I am quiet as a rider and cooperative and never caused any issues. I asked customer support if there is a mistake and if they can lift the suspension but they ignored my request. This is no way to treat a client. Uber deals with problems because it cannot handle the vast clientele it has currently and makes mistakes, but this is no way to treat someone like this.

I took Uber from IGT 1 to Sector 25 Noida and it shows rent of 820 approx. on Uber Premier, which looks good but when I reached my location without any stoppage driver asked me to pay 1210 rupees which is totally disappointing for me as prepaid taxi outside airport is even charging 950 rupees. But when I cross checked with my trip charges then I was shocked to see billing of 835 is showing on my app. I asked the driver to talk to Uber and check the same but he refused and asked to pay his charge as per his Uber application and write mail to Uber for the claim. I do took pictures of driver's mobile application screen and there is no transaction or reference number to track. Only amount, date, location is shown in it and same is with my trip detail in my Uber app. When trying to download receipt of this trip it's not opening as Uber Lite is not supporting this function. When trying to download Uber application it's not getting download. 
So friends I will suggest at last please don't trust Uber cab services. They don't have good management and after complaint services. They just lure customers with low rentals at first and charges high fares after completion of trip. How they can charge 1210 as per driver's application and give receipt of 835 on passenger's app... Totally fraud application and poor management services. Consumer court must black list these companies.

So my husband and I thought to let everybody know about our experience in New Orleans with Uber. We will never take Uber again. We went on vacation to New Orleans to take a cruise. We arrived the day before, The suggestion from our travel agent, just to make sure that nothing went wrong. We are new to Uber and our ride from the Comfort Inn Suites at the New Orleans airport to the Port of New Orleans on Feb 7 was the first time using Uber. This was at the suggestion of the Comfort Inn Suite and we were happy with the service that was provided to the Port of New Orleans. Mileage of 14.34 and drive time of 36 minutes as recorded with a value of $21.78. 
On our travel from the Best Western Plus on St Charles Ave to the Louis Armstrong airport on Feb 19 was a total of 15.77 miles and a trip time of 31 minutes and with a fare charge of (adjusted by Uber from $44.11) $39.07 is still $17.29 more than our first ride with only a difference of 1.43 miles and 5 minutes. It took two weeks to get a response back from Uber. This is unprofessional. We had explained in detail on the cost of all three of our trips with Uber, and the last trip, we were overcharged, due to the driver taking a longer route. Plus the driver was on the phone with his wife when driving. In Louisiana, law prohibits talking on your phone while driving, that is called ""Distracted Driving"" and the driver put us in harm's way and insurance companies like to hear about this when it comes to distracted drivers. 
We said that I will call both Hotels, and complain, we also said that I will get a hold of Uber Head Office, plus go on social media, and do a negative review, plus do a negative review on the Uber app. My husband and I are very upset on how this has been handled, with the Uber company in New Orleans to a point that they stop returning emails, even with the Uber app. That is a very expensive 1.43 miles and 5 minute ride. The first refund proposed by Uber was $.29. We find to be a joke and totally inadequate and we were hoping that Uber would reconsider a more substantial refund. They have refunded us so far around $10. When checking the distance to the airport it should’ve been $28.00. Since then we have not heard from Uber. Specially with the last email asking for the email for head office. 
So we are done with the games, will be posting this note on all social media to let everybody know be aware of Uber ripping customers off and for their safety. Plus we will also be placing this on the website of the hotels that we were staying at. This could’ve been prevented if they communicated with us and reimbursed us the difference which they did not. I guess money is more important than having a customer base.

I was in Montreal last week as it was raining. Wanted a quick ride to my destination so booked an Uber. The amount displayed was between 27-35 (which included surge). I didn't mind it as I was running late and wanted to get to the destination on time. Unfortunately there was an event taking place at the location and the cops had blocked some of the roads - due to heavy traffic and roads being blocked it took me 50 mins to get to my destination as opposed to 20 mins and to my surprise at the end of the ride the driver told me there is waiting time added to it which I wasn't aware off as Uber doesn't tell you the amount right away. You don't have the visibility as you do in most cabs. You can see the meter and make a quick decision of either taking the ride or stopping it right away.
Anyway my ride cost me $61 as opposed to a 25$ cab ride - I tried informing Uber via the app but there is no response yet. Not sure why they don't have a customer care number anywhere on the app. This is it. No more Uber for me and will let my friends know about this horrible experience too. Hopefully they will delete this app too.

I ordered an Uber around midnight, it said it was going to take 9 minutes so I waited, left the club with 1 min to spare, saw the car pull up, got in, only to be told the taxi wasn't for me - he hadn't even asked my name!. He said he wasn't taking me and to get out and drove away. I looked at my phone and it came up driver has cancelled. My original ride was going to cost £20. I tried to book another Uber and the price had been upped to £40-50!! I had to go home late at night on the tube with a walk at the other end which I didn't feel comfortable with. 
This has happened to me 3-4 times now. It's outrageous the drivers can cancel or call you beforehand and if they don't like where you are going or can charge more by cancelling - they just cancel. I've been left at 3am before on my own in a dodgy part of London. It's just not on. They need to book up their service as I for one am boycotting them from now on. Also on Uber when you first look at a trip it may come up 2-3 minutes but once you book, it then often changes to 5-6 minutes or even 10.

On 6/22 at 2:45PM I took an Uber. The driver (""Salaheddin"", who was a much larger man than me and could easily have removed me from his car) claimed that I was drinking in his car in the middle of the day and spilled it all over his seat. I demanded Uber refund the money and they showed me a picture of a cup with some liquid on it, and a car seat cover with some liquid on it. Probably not even his car.
They told me they assessed a $20 charge against me for it as a ""cleaning fee"". I told them many times I was not drinking from a party cup in an Uber at 2:45 in the afternoon, on an extremely short trip down the street, but they told me they would do nothing. For all the money I have given them I would think they would not want to lose my business but I guess I'm wrong. Obviously I won't keep taking $5 rides if I'm going to be charged random amounts of ""extra"" money at random times for made-up reasons. I feel Uber should be hit with a very large class action lawsuit and should stop punishing honest and well-mannered riders.

I have driven with Lyft for quite some time and I have a 5 star driver rating. I say that to clarify it's not me. I have been trying to sign up to drive with Uber quite unsuccessfully for the better part of year. With two separate accounts even. Both times with both accounts after passing background checks and all other necessary REQUIREMENTS they have held me up each time because they claim I am submitting a profile picture that isn't visible. I have submitted photo after photo after photo after photo, some of which were currently being used and or accepted by Lyft and Hyre. So it cannot be possible that these photos are anything other than exactly what is requested.
I have requested these issues be moved up the chain. They give the same canned response. It is clear that they are intent on keeping me from driving. I don't know if it’s because I'm female. They have been involved in many publicized sexist controversies or if it's because I am brown as they have had just as many of those scandals.

I take pride in driving, that is why I am quitting today. During drive time I may pick up a lawyer, a wink, a prostitute or kids that need a diaper change or a random person who doesn't bath.

If I am driving through a green light and it turns yellow one cannot stop in the middle of the street. There is a reason a passenger doesn't have a car. Uber never asks the driver about the passenger reports, so I am quitting. I will never give one of these passengers a ride anywhere in my car. Uber cheats drivers daily, they only hire Asian customer service reps, and the guy who works at the San Bernardino green light is a huge ** who wears a sweater and basketball shorts.

I booked an Uber ride and the driver immediately accepted the trip. The app showed me that the driver is very close to my starting point, but I could not find him anywhere.

I wrote to the driving asking him where he is. No reply, and I could see him moving towards my destination.
I had to cancel my trip. Uber charged me a cancellation fee. When I reviewed the fare and claimed it back, Uber refused to refund the fee and replied saying that it is against their standards. I mean seriously? What is their standard? To charge customers without giving them rides? It is not about the few dollars of cancellation charges, but it is about how they treat their customers.

Apparently, it must be an easy way for Drivers (and Uber) in the Miami, Florida area to make a quick buck without working, as I was hit with not one, not two, not three, but SEVEN bogus charges within the span of 2 weeks. The game apparently works like this: you request a ride, the driver accepts the ride request, the driver gets near the pickup spot, cancels the request, charges your card for the cancellation (hoping you never notice the charge), then goes on to his/her next victim in the area.
When I attempted to contact the Uber Company, I got a back-n-forth debate about the issue, and after my much persistence (for days), they offered to issue a credit for future rides, {But I DON'T WANT a credit with crooks} - I want the money that was Unlawfully Taken Out of My Account to be placed back into my account, but guess who won?

I used to absolutely love Uber and took daily trips to and from but I swear this year both Uber and Lyft's prices have skyrocket. Even riding pool has gone up tremendously. It's crazy that people have now decided to pay co workers weekly to carpool with them rather than get an Uber. More people are going to go back to trains and buses in order to save money to get to and from work. Either that, or go ahead and get a car because you'll end up paying a car payment anyway riding daily with this company if not more.
I knew after while, they would get greedy and forget about making prices cheaper for customers to get around. Prices have become very deceptive. You think your carpooling for $10 or $11 dollars as the price displays, then when you get your ride receipt it's $2 or $3 more. For that, you might as well had took a regular ride. I hope they are prepared to lose many more customers. People are going to stop riding daily and just use them when they just have no choice. SMH.

Uber steals what little drivers make and puts the money in their fat pockets. Doesn’t even come close to making minimum wage. Uber is too busy stealing from drivers while reducing their pairing. They control your earnings and steal 40% waste of time, money and gas. You’ll drive around more looking for trips than you would actually driving passenger. If you complain Uber retaliates. Uber has made numerous changes to drivers earnings while they collect all the profit including the pools that should count multiple passengers towards your quest. Instead only counts as one trip. You make less than minimum wage and isn’t even worth carpooling to work. Drivers are going on strike for a reason because Uber steals from them. Waiting two hours for a passenger nothing. It’s not even worth it carpooling to work.

I’m sitting in front of a passenger waiting for their Uber right now. Talk about wage theft. Uber deliberately spreads out your trips reducing your earnings. Uber steals money from drivers and puts the money in their fat pockets. Just drove by 20 minutes north, finally get paired only to travel 20 minutes south.
An FTC report Raiser LLC/Uber has changed their quest policy to reduce driver earnings by wage theft. They used to allow Uber pool to count multiple passengers towards our quest. They now removed this feature and only count one trip towards the quest regardless of the amount of Uber passengers that go in and out if the vehicle during their “trips”. If a driver does not complete the quest, Uber collects the money. Scam. Funny how this continues to get worse after Kalanick steps down from CEO.

The upfront price was C$30.78, the final price was C$37.66, and I took screenshots of both. I wrote to Uber and attached the two screenshot pictures. I was advised by Uber that there is a C$2.75 for booking Fee, and C$4.50 for Airport Surcharge, and Uber replied as follow: ""The estimated amount of the toll or surcharge is included in your upfront price before taking a trip. On this trip, your actual route included roads with tolls or surcharges that were not accounted for in your predicted route and your upfront price was adjusted."" 
In essence, Uber acknowledged that the upfront price should have included both of these charges but did not. The final amount charged to my credit card was C$27.66 after applying the C$10 promotional discount. Uber's final reply was there will be NO Adjustment. There was an offer (upfront Price) and there was an acceptance, and it constitutes a Legal Contract, but Uber did not seem to recognize that.

Very strange considering the first 2 trips were fine and documented and in my account. 
I ended up calling ""Uber"" 7 times trying to get my money and it was just the runaround. One ""Uber"" support guy said he was going to send me an email with steps to follow to help this issue resolve itself, he never did. Another tech support girl said the amount was less and gave a different amount. Another tech support girl gave me a higher trip fair amount and said I have to wait 48 hours to get my money. I got a different story every time with a different excuse each time. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they told me each time that he was busy on another line? 
I explained how slow ""Uber"" was in Huntsville, Alabama and that they only gave me 3 calls all day and that I needed to get paid, especially after I completed all trips and that $22.77 amount was much needed. It was the biggest fair out of the 3 calls in 8 hours of being online with ""Uber"". I went on my ""Uber"" dashboard to check the status and dashboard did not even show my 3rd trip completed and on my trip detail page, it did show the trip completed.? I have had many issues with the ""Uber"" app and have to constantly uninstall and reinstall the app. 
Bottom line is, Uber still has not paid me the $22.77 trip fair that was completed. I just want my money. Uber won't pay me. For the record, the Huntsville, Alabama is a terrible market for ""Uber"". I would get 13 calls a day in Florida and Texas and make $150.00 a day. But Huntsville, Alabama you get only 3 calls in 8 hours and make $37.00. Which actually, you don't even get that amount because ""Uber"" won't pay you. They will say there is an outage in your area???? Here it is another new day and ""Uber"" still has not paid me. So for yesterday, doing ""Uber"", I made $15.50. I am a 5 star, high rated driver with plenty of wonderful compliments and achievements. I can't believe I am getting treated like this. I am reporting to the BBB and social media. So beware, ""Uber"" you are crooks.

I use Uber when I miss the bus after work sometimes. The last two times it says a reasonable price usually about 8-10 dollars. Then after booking the ride and confirming the flash new price which has been 13-14 dollars. Then it asks if I want to pay 25 dollars to get to pay 9.99 for the ride instead of the 13-14 dollar price. This has happened 3 times now. I'm sorry but I'm not gonna pay 25 bucks so that I can pay another 10 for the ride home. That's ridiculous."

Do not! Trust or use this company. Uber does not care about their drivers nor the riders. I say this because 1st off. The 3rd party company that they use deny all. To whom may have any past minor traffic or minor offenses that do not concern with felons. I have no major offensive issues and felt with things to get my driver's license back. Been years! Still the 3rd party company will send Uber a red flag and deny all incoming new party meaning new applications for new drivers. They have been reported to many! Different local news agents and states. They also do not care about the drivers. Via YouTube reviews on Uber and the company. 
Now as for a rider I'll be suing Uber for the ride I tried to take with my service dog. The driver says this ""I am no dog taxi"" then proceeds to drive off. I hate this company and I forever will boycott this company. They broke federal law then just sends a apologized letter textbook answer then expects that to do the job? No, they are being reported to the BBB. Also being reported to the A.D.A service animal and disability act. Of 1990. They do the standard textbook response and try to avoid direct questions on what is going to be done on their end to provide better service and or fix the law breaking federal issue.

I used to be so happy with Uber until I got a ** driver who decided to scam me by taking a massive detour for some extra bucks even though he was aware at what time my flight was leaving. I was in the car with my baby girl in the car seat trapped on this traffic jammed highway asking him to please stay on route because I needed to catch my plane. Him giving me one ** story after another and keeps driving . By massive detour I mean a ride that usually even with heavy traffic takes an hour max. With his scheme it took me 2,5 hours.
The consequences were I missed my flight. Had to purchase a new ticket for 1000 bucks and had to leave 4 days later. And all Uber says, ""We took appropriate actions by giving you the scam money back"". Meaning the extra 75 bucks he earned with his scheme. I mean are you freaking serious. At least take some responsibility if you just hire people that are not trustworthy! I mean I know they can not influence everything and mistakes can happen but be lame with following up on a situation like this is just wrong. It made it so clear to me how vulnerable you are as an Uber passenger especially when you are sitting there with your baby.

All the cabs provided by Uber in India are extremely dirty and have a horrible stench settled in them which mostly comes from the drivers. The mats are literally matted with cakes of dirt and the seat covers are almost always stained. To top it all the drivers are really unprofessional, they refuse to come up on the pickup point and if they don't feel like executing the ride, the driver ends up calling the rider and asks them to cancel the ride. Hence lowering the rating of the rider. I have had extremely bad experience with Uber at multiple times. I have been dropped in the middle of the road by the drivers just because they didn't have an internet connection to check the maps. The drivers are racist as well sexist and on many an occasion have passed very rude and vulgar remarks."

People have been going on strike since Uber reduced the pay to drivers. It is now about the same as Lyft or a tad better. I am an Uber/Lyft Driver and let me tell you. I hope both of these companies go away. Let riders go back to Taxis days where they never show up or show up rude and disrespectful in unclean cars. Let's see if both of these companies will appreciate drivers and pay them fairly for the HARD work they do. Such as ending up in a place that's 1.5 hours and having to drive 1.5 hour home just for one trip and get pay nothing. They pay is very little to drivers considering gas (how expensive recently and continue rising as of May 13,2019), maintenance every 2-3 months, car depreciation with high mileage each day. Do not bother to go on Strike. Drivers please just GET OFF the road so that there's not many drivers left with no drivers on the road but tons of riders. 
I can understand taking a 20% of each ride is acceptable but taking 50-60% for a ride is UNFAIR. When there are no drivers left with high demand of riders needing rides home safely, there might be a change. Drivers keep drunk people safe, providing airport rides, and people with no means of transportation. Yet they are being treated unfairly and underserving. Let the drunks cause accidents and death on the road. Don’t work for Uber unless you have no other way to survive. Students or whoever need snack $ or some free time and do at a very minimum should do. It is not worth your car value, gas $ + maintain, and the hours you put in with little return. 
In addition, riders who DON'T KNOW how to rate decide they want VIP service and does not take rating seriously rate drivers poorly. Rating is a system to keep us drivers on the look out for dangerous riders. It should be used carefully and wisely. Not to rate however you please like 1 star for not talking and road-focused, for example. There A LOT of riders out there who CAN'T rate and decide they should rate. This then ruin the system that is built to keep drivers and riders safe alike. I refused to pick up riders with low rating due to safety reasons. Therefore, riders should rate seriously and fairly so that other riders will end up with safe drivers. Such as yourself! And we drivers rate riders to keep other drivers safe on the road. So next time you rate, do it mindfully. See attached photo for an example of many poor payout to drivers.

I have a serious problem. For about two and a half months now, Uber has put a restriction on my instant pay. They first claimed this was because a customer informed that I never delivered her food. This is not true. I do not even know who this customer is. So I filed an appeal through Uber. Then I called back to follow up on the appeal, but then was told that the reason there was a restriction is because I changed my account information too many times. I asked why would this be an issue. If this is a 1099 business type, I have the right to change it as many times as I want. I have a 4.8 star rating and have been employed with Uber for about 3 years now and never had a problem. I have always represented them in a dignified and respectable way. 
Since they have deactivated my instant pay, I have had a harder time financially. I was laid off this past Jan 29, 2019 and relied on Uber for financial support. However, since the instant pay was deactivated, I have had to borrow money from others to help support myself and my daughter. In other words, it has been such an inconvenience. I have tried and tried to get this deactivation off my account. I have done absolutely nothing wrong to deserve this. 
I know some people may say, just go work for LYFT. This is a matter of principle and how I am being treated unfairly. I have been more stressed out, embarrassed to have to ask for money and extremely aggravated. I filed an appeal twice. I have passionately expressed how horrible they have treated me, after I risk my life working for them for 3 years now. This is the thanks I get. The deactivation still has not been lifted. I have expressed, informed, literally cried about what they are doing is not right! I am so upset, and tired of this.

Wife and I recently started driving Uber after our teenager had surgery and we had 5 figures worth of out of pocket expenses. My wife started working with Uber 3 weeks before me and she referred me. Since then, I get non-stop promotions every single week for the last 3 months. Most recently I started getting ""objectives"" bonuses based on how many customers I take in a week to get an extra bonus.
Meanwhile, my wife has NEVER received even one single offer for a promotion or ""objective"". It is very unfair as she drives 3 times more than I do (I have full time job) and has extremely high ratings and comments from customers. We have called and complained about unfair and possibly discriminatory behavior of Uber giving better offers and more ways to make money to a ** male as opposed to a Hispanic female who Uber refuses to ever give any promotional driver offers to.
After the last time we complained about this, they promised she would start getting promotional driver offers, but that was almost 2 months ago and she still has never received any while I continue to get them weekly and only getting more and more. Uber has been unable to give any reason as to why I get non-stop offers for extra income and she can't get any so the only possible explanation we can believe at this point is that it is based on gender or race as there is no other explanation that we are aware of.

After comparing Uber and Lyft prices for about a $40 ride, I choose Uber although the price was slightly higher just as a preference. Few mins after the ride was complete, I received an email with adjusted fair, which was $10 more than the upfront price. When contacted Uber, they gave all kind of excuses to not refund the upcharge by claiming a route change etc. Driver (a human) missed one turn and took the next one which probably change the total by 0.8 mile. Not my fault or indeed anyone's, as this is a common occurrence. 
Second, explanation from Uber that tool route was used. Driver choose to use express lane when other lanes were as fast as express again by voice of driver, as he prefer express lane with tolls, that allow him to get faster to destination and make more trips. As per Uber I as a customer have to bear the cost of my driver's choice. Stop the unfair practice of charging your customer for other people's choice, and honor your upfront price.

Today evening around 8:50 pm, going from East coast Rd Intercontinental Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort in Chennai to EPA PACIFIC CITY APARTMENT which is 11KMs, I took Uber. Pathetic experience and worst thing I did. Driver was so damn rude and ill mannered and as the fare should have been maximum 150-200, somewhere between which is the unusual fare for this trip on. I paid RS 630+toll tax of 37 and driver telling me I owe RS 630 which was showing for my last trip from Intercontinental Resort to Airport which I didn't took! I couldn't understand WHY I was being falsely accused of having outstanding balance, nor WHY the fare should have been so much. Just 11kms. Quoted rupees more than the fare I already paid! 
After raising the devil on conversation from driver as I wasn't having cash (can't find any CS #), driver blaming tells me it's my fault to choose by cash instead! He also saying that his duty is left with few hours and to pay him in cash and as it's unusual amount and wasn't carrying that amount tried to change mode of payment by card which wasn't done as at the time of travelling and he told me to pay in his personal account then I told him if it's the drive through Uber I'll pay there. He wasn't accepted and he told me stating that ""you fight to customer care and pay me"" which was ridiculous as I already told I'm not carrying for unusual fare. He was even trying to become smart as it was already told I'll pay through card. Later I tried to change but wasn't accepting through app too. Moreover, I tried to call customer service but no number was reachable. Pathetic customer care service. 
Never ever going to take this service. Very first experience with Uber was highly pathetic. Ultimately as it was late for me as women and have to reach home. Ask the driver to take me ATM near which was hardly 15 meters and withdrawn cash and handover to him 630 to him he asked for 37 RS extra as toll tax.

I suppose my 1st; emotional review was rejected by this site because it was anonymous. Too bad because people say all truths with 1st story. So because they decided to support Uber and not post my real-life experiences, hear it a filtered narrative. I work for Uber but before I worked for Uber I was a passenger. Uber - Passenger: Uber is pre-installed on ALL androids because some politician was paid and lobbyist got this approved. This is probably why this company gets away with so much **. Uber is a technology and is run from Philippines or India with some fake headquarters in California. I called the California attorney general to issue complaints – THAT HOW I FOUND OUT.
The Attorney general can do absolutely NOTHING about internet businesses. I am not posting due to IP addresses and such – again our government protects EVERYONE but the injured. Uber is allowed to get all of your device's data according to my IT or phone repair guy. Your IMEI is your cell phone fingerprint unique to each device and UBER HAS IT which is why you are blocked if Uber decides to block ip address, credit care or other filters to block you in UBER LAND.
Uber allows 1 complaint refund per customer before you are flagged as wanting free services. But when you complain about a driver, the reason the driver is so withdrawn and defensive, is because UBER WILL NOT PAY THEM BECAUSE OF THE COMPLAINT or if they were paid before the complaint, UBER WILL TAKE THE PAYMENT BACK. Uber sends canned responses to both drivers and customers – as if they care. We all know who canned responses work – to make you feeeellll better.
Everything is electronic anyway. Uber has the ability to take photos from your phone (just like Google for Google Earth), track your precise location, track your speed and other things they deny – according to my IT phone repair person. This is what the lobbying did for them or allowed them to do. And because it's political, Uber is most likely permanent or until people start buying Apple products who actually PROTECTS customers unlike Android.
Uber the driver: My vehicle is not new although clean and reliable fresh off the used lot but because of the YEAR Uber approved me to work Eats ONLY. Makes you wonder about used – new vehicles don’t it. Uber obviously KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR GOV than we do. Anyway, after being a passenger I fully understood why their drivers were so standoffish. Working for Uber puts you into a financial hole. We have to have vehicle inspections at BELL TIRE only and BELL won’t approve another, cheaper mechanics work. They SAY Eats don’t have to be inspected but Uber will force that. Seeing THEY know where you are at all times, Uber - the technology, is well-aware when you stopped into a Bell Tire location. 
The apps registers how long you been there, if you moved around while there, wherever that phone is, Uber follows! I have noticed that most McDonald's take advantage of drivers. The restaurant will cancel orders and 'cause friction between the customer and the driver…it's like a game for Uber and McDonald's employees. Uber passengers are NOT supposed to be able to personally contact the drivers but Uber will allow that from time to time releasing my personal information to customers. I guess they THOUGHT it would be some fight, but I don’t fight people because I understand the game here. I did speak with a customer about some things and allowed them to SEE my phone as I only used it for Uber. I always help the customer determine before getting their blood pressure out of sorts. 
SOME drivers are fired, the ones McDonald's don’t like?! Funny, I worked for McDonald's before. They line Uber drivers up alike cattle rather than having your food ready and pick at us trying to anger us or see who will crack. I did record this with my NON UBER DEVICE. Sometimes Uber directions are wrong and I would have to use my NON UBER device to get to the customer's location ON TIME. The Uber app, which is linked to GOOGLE Maps is NOT SUPPOSE TO GET IT WRONG. 
According to my IT phone repair, Uber manipulates. GOOGLE has NEVER been wrong with directions and will even tell you which side of the street to look for the address, but UBER won’t tell you a darn thing. If the customer complains, THEY WON'T PAY – PERIOD. Uber even makes drivers go to locations that have been cancelled for the “mileage” I was put on discipline for not taking UBER DIRECTIONS which had me in traffic but used my NON UBER device to get to the location FASTER. Uber sent me an email telling me “YOU WERE LATE”???? I took screenshots of all of my trips, payment, etc. 
When Uber gets upset, you are disconnected from their app and you will not get your tax documents. I hung out at Uber HUB to find this out from other drivers. As my own experience because I talk to drivers at Uber hub to better understand, they all GO IN ok and COME OUT with the devil in them. The Uber hub people be making people so angry! They look, dress and act like ex – cons anyway. Uber hub is ONLY nice to the worst drivers – those who behave most like taxi drivers. Yep, Uber is cheaper than a taxi but I am gonna do it the ol’ fashion way – CALL A FRIEND. I don’t like to play that manipulation game.

Uber's customer service is beyond horrible. It's been three weeks and I still can't get them to reset my account. Someone answers after three emails maybe. Then they ask the same questions. And then never respond again. If you have an issue, don't expect it to ever be solved. This isn't my first encounter. My previous company stopped working with them as a business client because they never responded to any of our emails."

I booked a ride for 7:30 AM and the driver shows up at 7:05 and calls me to come down. I politely said I would be there in about 10 minutes and that I had booked my ride for 7:30. The driver hang up and didn't say anything until the end of the trip when I arrived at the airport, only to find that I was charged a considerable (almost 15% of the whole bill) fee for ""waiting time."" How is this ok when the trip actually started earlier than scheduled, which was entirely at the driver's will? Now that I did some research, it seems that in 2017 Uber added tons of hidden fees that are controlled 100% by drivers so they had many more ways to get paid more, of course by the consumer who knows nothing all so that Uber didn't have to spend a cent more on their contractor drivers. Utterly a scam. 
This is unethical as both a business and a contractor, it put me in a stressful situation where I was rushed even though the actual trip started well ahead of the scheduled time, yet I was charged almost 15% extra for a wait fee all because the driver knew he could do this and get away with this. Will NEVER use Uber again as this business employs shady tactics and allow its drivers to blatantly scam consumers and levy bogus charges. No wonder all their ratings on review sites are rock bottom, it's a wonder that they have any customers at all after all the little gimmicks they put in to screw their customers.

Uber's human customer service for riders is deliberately non-existent. The only service offered is via the app. There is no way to send email to Uber describing a problem. There is no way to send feedback to Uber except via the app, and then only tightly restricted responses are possible. I somewhat get it. There are countless millions of Uber riders, and Uber does not want to spend money reviewing random complaints. But I have found no way to provided feedback for a very serious problem.
My Uber driver arrived at my location, then picked up the wrong rider. I had to call the driver to cancel my request to avoid paying for the non-ride. And what is worse, I could not request another ride until the bonehead driver completed the cancellation. And I then had the wasted time involved in requesting another ride. And there is no way to inform Uber about the defect in their process that allows this problem, and permits the bonehead driver to escape my rating of 0.

I've never had a problem with Uber until last night. I scheduled a ride last night and it cost $12.00. When I called for a pickup they told me it would be a while and that the price went from $12.00 to $40.00 because they were busy, what B.S. So I wheeled my friend and her wheelchair at night in the dark at 12 midnight through a bad area because no one was available to pick me up and I only had enough money for the original price of $12.00.

Firstly Uber uses an outsourced call center to receive and take calls for their company. The employee I spoke to was a supervisor by the name of JOHN who was in the Philippines. He did not care about my concerns about my safety. They are unconsidered with their employee’s SAFETY. The driver is unaware of who they are picking up or even where they are going until the rider gets in the car. I have had questionable riders get into my vehicle and ask to be taken to areas that’s did not feel or look safe. Ubers only consider is making sure you get the rider to their destination and not how to protect its drivers from harm while driving. This company should really evaluate the safety for not only their riders but their Drivers as well. 
These companies will make a extra buck but not allow its driver to have any protection with them while operating the application. The most they give their drivers is an emergency button which calls the police in the event of an emergency. What is a button going to do if you are currently under attack? How is a button going to save me from an crazy person getting in my car and decided to attack me? How is a button going to save me if I have to drive late at night and have to take a rider to a unsafe part of town, from a person who wishes to do harm to me? UBER wants its riders to feel comfortable. What about the DRIVERS. GA law allow me the right to protect myself. 
Uber denies its drivers the legal right to be accompanied by a family member or a friend. They deny the right to allow their drivers to bear arms. They allow the rider to go where they please, invite whoever they want to share a rider, and transport whatever they please. All the while the driver is unaware and vulnerable. I am 5.5 ft and weight 120. I have 2 small children and a husband who depend on me. It will be very hard for me to fight a person. It would be very tragic if a DRIVER was hurt or placed in a compromising situation, and the only thing UBER provided is a button to call for help. Hopefully the person doing the harm is willing to wait for emergency response to arrive.

Apparently Uber EATS in Canada doesn’t give a crap about their customers. My order was so simple, yet they managed to screw it up anyways YET AGAIN.

Apparently someone from the McDonald’s at St Clair/Victoria Park (Toronto, Ontario) thought it would be hilarious to douse my Junior Chicken with a bunch of Chili Pepper Flakes and some strange tasting sauce.
I’ve experienced a few issues in the past with Uber EATS regarding tardiness of delivery and even food quality and most times Uber EATS resolved the situations very professionally and even refunded me on a few occasions but after this whole experience and even SENDING IN PHOTO EVIDENCE of this malicious and disrespectful gesture. The best they could do was send me a message saying how “sorry” they were and that there is nothing they can do and I should just get in touch with the restaurant and leave feedback through the app. For all they know I could of been ALLERGIC to chili peppers and COULD HAVE SUED.

I have tried contacting him again through the Uber App, which is the only way I know to get in touch with him. No return calls yet. I then went back to the app and followed the ""can't contact the driver"" link and have reached out to Uber to become involved -- twice. No response from Uber.

I had both Lyft and Uber apps and when I needed to go somewhere, I would compare the prices on both. In doing this comparison one day, I saw that Uber was a lot cheaper that day (which almost never happens) by about $2 something. I jumped at it and booked my ride with Uber and was taken to my destination. I paid and thought that was it. THE NEXT DAY (I swear), Uber charged me an ADDITIONAL $2 something (just about identical to what the difference in prices between Uber and Lyft were for that distance).
When I contacted customer support, they said, ""We readjusted your rate (AFTER THE fact the following day no less) because of toll charges"". I told them, ""When you quote the customer a price, that price is supposed to include that already"". They refused to do anything. Just because they have our credit card information, doesn't give them the right to ring it up whenever they feel like.

He left me at my destination leaving me all the way on the other side making the fare that much higher. I had to pay an additional $15 to the $7.63 I had to pay for the last one.
Being that he was so rude and drove dangerously I asked for a full refund (of the $7.63) and was denied. They instead credited me $5 in my account which I was no longer interested in being that I refuse to give my money to a company that doesn't care about professionalism or safety of their customers.

He passed me one napkin and I tried to wipe it as best as possible.
Hours pass and I get an updated receipt email that my $12.50 ride has now become $54.00 because they were charging me a $40 cleaning fee. I genuinely thought this was an error because why would anyone charge 40 dollars to clean spill coffee. I emailed Uber because you cannot speak to a person on this app and received a bunch of responses from different people defending this cleaning fee.
Stating it was an industry cleaning standard fee and that they were not there to see the spill for themselves. I stated that I get Uber was not in the car however they should hold some loyalty to their true customers and at least try to dispute this with driver or charge less than 40 l. I have no issue paying a small cleaning fee since I know it wasn’t cool of me to spill it and leave it. I acknowledge that and felt the cleaning cost would be $5-10 at most and not $40. Uber did not take any responsibility and automatically charged my credit card the additional 40 dollars. When I asked Uber the least they could do was split cost with me they said the money was sent directly to driver. This is a lie and it was just one total deducted from account. I am warning people that Uber is an awful company and they do not hold themselves accountable. I hope this company is shut down. Sincerely, Robbed

I'm so tired of Uber not caring for me as their driver! The GPS is 90% wrong! We losing time and money chasing around customers and don't get paid for it! We have a lot of one way street in Denver and the GPS keeps on telling you to turn where you are not supposed to turn! 2 months ago I followed their routes with customers on the car and got a ticket from police for wrong turn and Uber told me it was on me! Washing their hands from their navigation problems! How can a multibillions dollars company make their money on navigation and have navigation problem??? Also they get paid the same as us driving if not more than us on rides! We have to pay gas and oil change and tires and and and... Not to mention the tear and wear that brings the value down of our car! So stop finding ways to pay us less!!! Respect your drivers!"

I took Uber for the first time last month. My wife and I were at the Tokyo Airport and had many bags. We would have had to wait a few hours for a base bus on standby.

My husband and I use UBER or Lyft frequently when we go out because we don't want to drink and drive, even a little. We moved a little over a year ago so now our average ride is about 25 minutes since we aren't as close to where we go with our friends. Without a doubt, at least the driver going there or coming home makes a complaint about the drive because they would like to stay in the busy area and just do a lot of short drives. It makes for a very uncomfortable ride. I even had one complain the whole time and then make sure I knew there was now an option for tipping. I tip almost all of the time but when I am made to feel uncomfortable because the driver has to do their job and drive me home, just farther than they would like, why would I tip that driver?! We all have things about our jobs we don't like but your main job is to drive."

Uber is convenient and fast. Cheaper than yellow cab. The platform has changed though with the nearby location pickup which is confusing at times because the location might be a couple of blocks from where you requested and the drop off time is near where you want to go even though after drop off the car drives past the location of drop off.

I tried to do instant pay at Wawa. Called. They said I needed to update my card info. When I did that it refused to let me update because of a security issue. I called. The guy said he couldn't help me. I asked for a manager and he continued to argue with me. I had to keep telling him to put someone else on the phone. I had to hang up and call back. Got someone else. He told me I'd just have to wait 45 minutes. So I waited. Updated the card info. Went to go instant pay... Locked me out of the system again saying security issue. Called back. Got the first guy again. Great I thought. I could hear plenty of people laughing in the background. He put me on hold saying it was to pull up my info, but really it was to wait for them to quiet down. 
Then the guy tells me I can't have my money for two days because I did this on a new phone. It was the same number with the same email, and I told him I needed the money to get home. He said he couldn't do anything. I've had so many problems driving for Uber, I've had 0 for Lyft. My card was expired which started this. But I did instant pay with Lyft about three days prior. They still have the routing number. There should be no problem. Uber's customer service should be ashamed. Save yourself a headache. Drive with Lyft...

I ordered an Uber at the airport for me my boyfriend and his parents so 4 people and a couple luggages. The Uber pulled over, opened his truck and suddenly closed it and said We were too many passengers (which we weren’t) and told me to cancel the ride 'cause he wouldn’t take us and just drove off. I was really upset and cancelled as per the driver's instruction and was charged a 5$ cancellation fee. I’ve been talking back and forth with Uber customer service for 4 days now and they refuse to credit me the fee even though they admit I’m right and apologized for the bad experience. Their reasoning is that too many fare adjustments were made on my account (which were warranted 'cause I was indeed overcharged on a few trips).

This company should be out of business... I returned to Uber after 1 1/2 years just to make a little money to pay a bill. I drover March 9 and 10 for about a 1 each day. I made $68.27. I needed the money fast to pay a bill on Monday March 11, I tried to cash out and they stop me from cashing out... They kept saying something was wrong with my bank information... How can that be when I've had the same bank information for over 5 years and the same as when I drove for them a year and a half ago.
Back and forth with the customer service... I get this stupid email saying to respond over the line... What line... There are three lines. I asked. They claim they need to verify my information. They verified my info when I call by asking me my birthday and other information, they email me, they text me and they also send me rides... they also asked me to take another picture while I was driving. So I do not see what other information they need.
Then I get an email saying I have to drive 80 miles to a ""Green Hub""... not telling me why... and not telling any other information. Why I should drive from South Jersey near Philly to Secaucus NJ to visit a GREEN HUB. They make all the excuses not to pay me... but they did not need verification to take their cut out... If anybody is doing a class action lawsuit. PLEASE COUNT ME IN AND CONTACT ME! Why are they using third world country to have our personal information?

Some of the rides were great, some were awful. One car had no A/C, another car had a seat full of crumbs that I had to sit in, another car had all the seats slashed, another was not the car I asked for, but a very high Chevy Truck I could not get into. I had to go inside the doctor's office, where I had just left, to get a stool so I could climb into the truck. The Uber driver refused to cancel as he would be penalized, and I refused to cancel for the same reason. To end the stalemate, I was lucky the doctor's office had a stool. Uber is great for when you need a ride and are unable to drive for medical or other reasons. However, Uber does not seem to have any consensus control over the cars people are driving.

I went to log in to my Uber Eats account to order food and I got an error message saying something was wrong with a past order. I went to my account and it immediately took me to Uber Rides site (which I have never used). I could SEE my partner's credit cards but I couldn't delete them.

Bob tells me he used a different card than the one on the account. I tried to order today, it wouldn't let me. I tried to see if the last order was outstanding, the site showed it was paid for. I entered yet another card totaling FOUR cards they have now! None worked. ALL are more than fine. Why are they asking for credit card info and not allowing me to remove it? If they aren't going to use any of them to place this order or pay for a supposed back order, then what are they doing with them?! 
I can't even delete my account. Says b/c outstanding balance due! I called ""customer service"". A kid at home with another kid screaming in the background. She didn't see anything wrong on her end and couldn't delete the cards either. So they tell me there's an outstanding balance. They tell me there isn't an outstanding balance.

Won't let me. So I try to delete my account. Won't let me. No one responds to emails. The phone #s are outdated and lead to a child. THIS IS STEALING.
They also ask you to tip the driver and then ask again and again and again. You think it's glitch at first so you keep repeating your tip. Somebody got 20 bucks somewhere.

I have no idea why the heck I was charged so much money! I thought the whole point of doing a carpool was to SAVE MONEY... but no, it cost MORE freaking money than if I had ordered a solo trip AND a couple of girls got picked up AFTER me but got dropped off FIRST which added half hour-45 mins to my trip home. 
We were so close to my house and she had to go pick up and drop off other people. And then I had to pay for the extra distance and time?! SERIOUSLY?!?! I can't even deal with how pissed off I am. Some of us have little to nothing in our bank account and we need to know ahead of time exactly how much will be taken out. Going from $6 to $22 is an insane and unacceptable price jump.

They own their cars. They are clean and don't smell. They are motivated and speak to us as punters as opposed to taxi drivers who often smell and don't give a jot and often try and cheat by driving the wrong routes to bump up the fare. The taxis are also sometimes wrecks in need of repair or replacement."

I have had to cancel 2 credit cards because of multiple & repeated fraudulent charges by ""Uber Technologies"". While the the credit card company reversed the charges, I'm still put through the hassle of changing everything tied to the cards. The credit card company also advised me to contact Uber to complain, but Uber has NO CONSUMER SERVICE, NO EMAIL & NO TELEPHONE NUMBER to report this - unless you sign up with Uber & create an account (giving them credit card & personal info). There is no way I'm going to do that.
I have never used Uber, never created an account with them, never paid for an Uber ride (for me or anyone else)... in short, there is no reason for them to have my credit card info or charge me. The fact that they do not act responsibly enough to provide a mechanism to report and prevent fraud committed by their company indicates that they are willing to encourage it. In addition to all of the other problems Uber has allowed to happen to their riders, it looks as if they are now part of a larger scheme to allow financial fraud to occur.

I decided to try Uber and get a ride from the local airport. I downloaded the app and booked my first Uber ride. I was watching my ride get closer and closer and I found out the name of the driver and type of car I was to be looking for. Once my ride arrived, I was welcomed by the driver that I was expecting except for there was another person waiting for the same Uber. I waited a long time for this Uber since it was 11 pm and snowing. Needless to say, the other person got the Uber because her name was on his phone. I even showed the guy my phone and when I ordered the ride which was before the other rider. I was livid. I ended having to find a cab and paying a ton more for a short ride to my car. I will never again support Uber or recommend Uber to anyone."

I was recently left stranded by an Uber driver who canceled my pick up when he was only 1 minute away after I had been waiting for him for 15 minutes. He gave me no explanation. The Uber app automatically reassigned me another driver, but I had to cancel this one because I no longer had time to wait for another driver who was 20 minutes away. I was going to miss my bus to the airport.
Now I have a second complaint. I cannot give feedback directly to Uber about the driver who stranded me. When I go into my account to try to register a complaint only the poor driver who was reassigned to me at the 11th hour is showing in my record. Since I canceled that ride, the Uber system won’t let me lodge a complaint because it has no connection between me and the first driver. No doubt this first driver is counting on anonymity and knows it would take a Herculean effort to lodge a complaint for what he did because he has disappeared from my app record.
Drivers who pull stunts like this for the shorter rides hurt Uber’s reputation. But, what I think is almost worse, is that there is no way to reach Uber by telephone, email or via the app to let them know what this first driver did as a representative of their business. I have tried all of those to no avail. It shows they don’t care about customer service.

I was using it every day and it was costing between 18 and $21 each way and then you get for people in bidding and they actually ripped me off hundreds and hundreds. I want to say thousands of dollars running my card and fighting over who was going to pick me up and yet I have not had any of my money returned are refunded. Getting through to a human being is like finding a needle in the haystack. They did not contact me back after writing a letter as well as contacting them by email and I don't appreciate all the rides that I did with them. I didn't receive one ride. All the people that I gave my share a code to 100s of friends and family not once did I get the $10 or $10 free ride or all the other things that they say it is. 
It got out of control and you should be able to contact a human being when they're running your credit card and you didn't even get on and three people have your number. Very unprofessional, unethical and bull crap. Not only did they steal money from me they stole money from people are referred to them that I did not get my credit or my free ride after spending thousands over $4,000. They did it to my family and my adult children and that's where I draw the line. 
And trying to fight it with certain credit card companies is a big joke. The worst one was Romano's Law Firm and the guy didn't even have shocks on his vehicle and he had every Dollar Store air freshener in the car and you couldn't roll down the window and I have a spine injury so every bump he hit I could feel. No concern as to roll down the window. And there's people that are highly sensitive to those nasty air fresheners and he had every single one you can ever imagine - hundreds of them was disturbing.

Please be careful when ordering from Uber Eats!!! They take no responsibility!!! They don’t work with you at all. I use both Uber and Uber Eats almost daily. I have many saved places in my phone. A friend who doesn’t have Uber asked me to order her food and I did. So when I ordered my own food I didn’t realize that I didn’t change back to my home address. I noticed this instantly and cancelled my order. Uber charged me for the order stating that I cancelled after the restaurant accepted the order!! I said, ""They do that instantly, so when do I have time to cancel my order without penalty of paying for an entire meal that I didn’t receive?"" 
This is the second time I asked Uber for some type of compromise with my money and they won’t work with you at all. I feel that if you guys want to stay in business you should try catering to the consumer a little more. No one is going to keep returning to a company that doesn’t help them when it regards to their money. Please be careful people.

Been driving for Uber about a year now and am very unhappy with the way they conduct business. There are so many issues that I could write all day about, but needless to say their app is flawed and their customer service is a joke. They are not consistent on how much they pay and since I have so many passengers throughout the day it's near impossible to keep track of the details of every fare. But after 2000+ passengers you start to get a sense of basically how much you'll get paid for rides taking a certain amount of time going a certain distance. Uber compensates me different amounts periodically, sometimes it will be a fair amount while other times I feel very shorted, of course I've never felt overpaid... Imagine that.
If you have a problem you have to call their hotline and go through an automated system, get transferred, placed on hold, then finally reach someone who jabbers on and on with chatter tags that are basically read from a cue card that it seems like they have been instructed to repeat after every sentence. And of course ultimately they don't actually help you anyway. As a driver this means if I have a problem I have to either navigate to their FAQ, which answer NOTHING by the way, or go through this phone process which takes 15-20 minutes of my time, time that I cannot afford to waste. Lyft allows you to message or email them and they get back with you promptly!
Unfortunately for me at this time Uber ride requests dominate my area in Austin Texas, but I hear Lyft is gaining speed and if it ever gets to where I can drive for them without needing Uber I'll definitely take it. Uber your days are numbered, you've done too much damage and it does seem you are making any better decisions, it will take a while because you have grown so huge. But mark my words if you continue the way you are treating passengers and drivers you will fall... It's a mathematical certainty.

My husband and I arranged a ride to the airport with Uber. We were notified the evening before our ride that our ride had been set up. When the time for our pick up, with no driver in sight, had come and gone by not just a few minutes but by almost 30 minutes we realized we had to get ourselves to the airport in order to catch our flight. This not only caused a lot of undue stress but a whole lot of money. We had to pay for 2 days of parking at the airport and for someone to pick up our vehicle.

Uber's customer service is horrific and nearly impossible to use when in need of solving something quickly - or at all. The lack of responsibility that this company takes with its clients is awful and if Lyft were in Mexico, I would use it instead. As such, I will never use Uber again. Uber needs better security for its riders against theft, especially in countries that have little to punishment for crimes.
If you lose your phone, you have to reach out to Uber via their website. I got a response about 10 hours later. Uber contacted the driver who simply said that he didn't have my phone even though it was turned off within five minutes after I exited the vehicle. I called it from another line right when I realized I didn't have it. So Uber assumes no responsibility. The driver assumes no responsibility. I have to buy another phone. Great work encouraging theft, Uber.

I’ve been using Uber for years. Then I tried to use it and there was a 7.00$ bal due. That’s impossible as it’s paid automatically so I pushed the button to pay and then it said I was deactivated. What did I do? I can’t get into my account to ask, can’t find a number to call. I have used this account for years. I’m livid!!"

I will never use Uber again. I submitted a complaint and received a $5 credit, before even hearing what my problem was. So I sent this: ""I received an email yesterday regarding this and it said I received a $5 credit. I would like more than that and most importantly I would like confirmation someone looked into this man’s license. I would never want someone to go through what my friends and I went through, while trying to be safe and responsible. I have also not told anyone about how horrible this guy was and how many times I felt like my life was at risk.
The Uber was from NYC to Long Beach, NY. While going through the tunnel we never went over 20 MPH, which I thought no big deal I tend to drive slow through them too. As lights flashed the entire time and horns honked I still did not think it was bad. When we got out of the tunnel he practically stopped the car to look at his phone GPS to see where to go up ahead. This in return almost caused an accident as I turned my head to see the car behind us swerve to get into the open lane so the car behind him didn’t hit him. As we drove on the LIE he did not go over the speed of 30 MPH, and in case you aren’t familiar the speed limit is 55 MPH and has signs saying you have to go over 40 MPH. 
I could see in the side view mirrors lights flashing out of control at him because not only did we not stay in the right lane, but we kept changing lanes without a blinker to notify the drivers. We would spend about 3 minutes in each lane (yes I timed it) before just moving over cutting off the cars swerving all over the place, honking their horns and flashing their lights. We told him multiple times about the speed limit and going to slow and I don’t believe he spoke any English. He made us drive in silence with the heat on blast and anytime we asked to lower it he ignored us. 
Finally after what felt like an hour on the LIE (it probably was and it should have taken only an hour to get home) we started down streets that had street lights. At the first three we hit, he stopped at the green lights as if it was a stop sign. One was right after the ramp to get off the LIE where people go extremely fast and he stopped cause a car to go around us on the opposite side of the road to avoid hitting us. When we got to Merrick Road we have to make a left turn and there is a median in the middle of the east bound and west bound traffic, he not only stopped at the green light but turns left but on the wrong side of the median. We screamed at him as cars were coming at us and he had to reverse (in the middle of a very populated road) to go back and go around the median. 
Now we are going down the road at 25 MPH while cars are flying by us at 50 MPH honking and trying to swerve around him because we are in the middle lane trying to make a right turn. We inform him yet again of the speed limit and if he does not exceed the minimum he could get pulled over. He continues at 20 MPH the rest of the way down Long Beach Road. While down that road, it is a straight drive up until our block which his GPS says. He then decides to switch lanes, from left to right in one shot at 20 MPH cutting off a cop car. I believe the only reason he was not pulled over was because it could have been out of jurisdiction. Our street (West Broadway) is a one lane street but he insisted on driving down it as if it was 2 lanes and was driving in the bike path. After getting dropped off we found him stopped at the green light by our house for about 10 minutes.
That ride was completely unacceptable and I regret not calling the police after we were dropped off. I never felt safe one time in this ride, and I will be looking at additional ways to report this driver to authorities and the public, whether it be by social media and reviews. I am not trying to complain, I am trying to save the lives of anyone else put in the position we were put in. Between myself, friends and colleagues I am in an Uber at a minimum of 5 times a week. I have already started telling them what happened to me and to spread the word about the experience I had and the response received from your company was a $5 credit.
I have attached his information again."" The answer I received was that apparently they cannot provide a refund. So apparently they can't take care of the safety of their customers because a refund is not my number one concern. my concern was for my safety, the people I had in the car with me and the safety of others. if you are taking an Uber out of NYC PLEASE make sure you are not in a car with Harpeet, he drives a silver Elantra.""

I have always used Lyft due to negative info about Uber. After receiving an Uber gift card I went to Uber.com & checked balance. Uber not only downloaded $100, it advised I have an account under my email with a wrong phone #. As I tried to enter my REAL # a message stated that phone # was already associated with an account. I have received 10 emails from Uber that all ask for snapshot of phone # & sim info and NOTHING has been done to correct this problem. I have done everything possible to resolve this & at one point was advised Uber is not accepting cash gift cards! This is ridiculous, put the $ back on the card since I have already had to spend $45 using Lyft!! I have also reported to the BBB."

Uber deactivated my account with no reason given. My in-app Help section was inaccessible because they deactivated my account. I contacted Uber via Facebook and was assured Uber has already or would soon be emailing me. After 48 hours, I have not yet received an email from Uber to resolve my deactivated account.

I correctly entered in the destination on the app but when the driver arrived he couldn't take me because he showed my pick up location as the destination, on his phone. So he had to leave without giving me a ride. I canceled my Uber account immediately and got Lyft, which completed my ride. Uber has no personalized customer service for their customers. It's all robotic ""check item below that best describes your issue"" then read the advice. THE WORST ONLINE-SERVICE COMPANY IN THE WORLD."

I requested a ride for Uber to the nail salon with a stop at Starbucks on the way for 11.59. I ended up having to cancel the stop and just go straight to the nail salon. When I checked my app, the price I was charged was 17.57. So I disputed it through chat which is apparently the only way to contact them and was told the charges were valid because I had made a change. So what y’all are telling me is by shortening the ride I increased my price by almost $6? I spoke to several different people about the issue half of which either called me the wrong or had the situation incorrectly. The end result being Uber simply ignoring my last 7 messages. I am absolutely floored by the way they treat their customers."

My account has been blocked for no reason and without warning my Uber stopped working one day, and while I have been using other platforms, I have emailed them several times, I sent them my ID and the cc they asked for, I have contacted them through the app and Twitter and they keep passing the ball to each other and don't respond my questions or emails and 3 weeks later nothing has been resolved and no answer to my emails. Terrible service from such a company. I also learned that is illegal on of the countries I visited so won't be using ever there."

I booked a ride to my grocery store (HEB in Austin). Getting there was fine. When I was ready to go home, the app malfunctioned and I could not connect to Uber to book my trip home. I had good Internet coverage (I checked) and my phone was working perfectly fine. I just kept getting a read error message across the bottom of my screen ""Cannot connect to Uber."" (or something similar to that). I am 77 years old suffer from Stage III COPD and back injury and typically only used transportation for the disabled. I am on oxygen and was carrying that equipment, as well as my handbag and a very heavy bag of groceries.
I had to find a bus stop - ride the bus home and then walk up a steep hill to get to my apartment. I had to walk a most a mile and today am paying a very steep price for having been left stranded. When I got home I sent a message to Uber explaining what had happened. Starting 6 hours later, I received 5 email messages one after the other, each one asking me to send a screen print of the error message to them. I wrote back explaining that the error message was no longer on my phone since 7 hours had elapsed., I continued to get the same message and responded in the same way each time. Today they asked me to book a test trip and to cancel immediately which I did. App working fine today, but I will never trust Uber again. Why would anyone.
At my age, with my health conditions, ever be able to trust Uber again. I had a $50 gift certificate given to me by my granddaughter for Christmas. I used it for 3 one way trips for a distance of 2 miles each trip and half of it is gone, but Uber refuses to refund the balance on the gift certificate to me or to my granddaughter. At no point was there any attempt to apologize or to ask what needed to happen to ever trust them again. The only way to contact them is through a form on their website - no # to call - no human being who seems to give a darn. Shabby - shabby service!!

My purse was stolen by my Uber driver. I left it in backseat around 9:30a on 2/25/19, and this guy tipped myself $27 on a $13.50 trip then did extra rides for himself using my Uber account, yep he change my pw kicking me and my daughter out of the app. How you ask, because my personal cell with app access was in his car (currently using work cell) in the purse he stole. Using my locator app I saw he went across the bridge back to NJ so it adds more proof. Then he lies to Uber rep, saying he didn’t have my bag yet when I threatened to go to the police he lies again saying he dropped it at 3 separate locations. So, if he didn’t have it as he told Uber, why claim you dropped of a bag you never had... LIES!
What’s worse is that they’re taking his word for it even though I have proof of him tipping himself, lying about dropping off my purse and more and showing my cell in NJ 25 minutes after he dropped me off and while I was communicating with Uber by phone. Calling was wasting my time since he said he didn’t have it, his word was law. I went to Uber Hub on Bartram Rd the same day and they swore up and down they’d help but I’ve heard absolutely NOTHING since reporting the incident in that office on 2/25/19! As a result of Uber not caring or helping I’ve had to pay to get all apartment locks changed, cancel all credit & debit cards, change bank account numbers, buy a new Galaxy Note, order new ID, buy another purse, miss multiple days at work Mon-Wed due to no access to funds until replacements comes which will likely make me late paying rent, and filed a police report. 
So I ask you, is this really a company to do business with, and why the hell does no one care enough to help me? I’ve never given Uber a bad review because I used them so much and used to love them until riding with Joshua from Jersey on 2/25. Now if it has Uber in the name I won’t use it, even Uber Eats. And I will make it my mission to spread this situation to ANYONE who will listen which will be easy because I work for a large communications company in center city Philadelphia. Just sad?

After working for several months in an area without Uber, I returned to find the Uber had several large ‘pending charges’ on my account. As we are in the process of closing on a house, making sure our accounts are straight is critical... Yet there are the Uber charges soaking up funds without ever going into a status to dispute them. Uber rather unhelpful ‘help’ page says these charges are necessary to verify account. Normally, these charges are pennies... Not the same amount as a ride (for each of several ‘verifications’)?
Obviously, this should be a simple matter to report to Uber and have resolved, right? Nope. No recent rides means there is no method of contact. In app customer service is unavailable and literally every public available contact number leads nowhere. Even the ‘emergency contact’ numbers go nowhere, so it’s comforting to know that Uber won’t even let you report a violent assault? There is literally no way to contact Uber about a simple issue and have it resolved short of directly writing the CEO... Whose strategic vision requires his direct notification to initiate a simple customer service action? To Uber has the worst and least effective customer service I have ever encountered would. At least require them to have customer service. I hope Lyft likes the bump in business.

I have used Uber several times and had no issues until I ran into them incorrectly billing me for a ride in October 2018. I noticed that I had requested a ride to Newark airport for a colleague and they billed me the ride to Flushing, NY instead and doubled the price. I disputed the charge with my credit card company but paid them $38.00 for the ride. After that I tried to get them resolved but it is so difficult since they are clueless and have no intention to resolve the issue. Two weeks back I requested an Uber and they would not confirm the ride due to the rightfully disputed charge. 
I used a different card to pay for my ride and guess what they bill my disputed charge back on my card for $77.53 while they have already been paid for in Oct for the valid amount of $38.00. Worst company to deal with to resolve any issues! So, I disputed the charge again with my other credit card company. Will never use Uber again! They should be investigated for their incorrect billing to customers.

On 2/22, I rode from my office to my home 7 miles in 10 minutes and was charged $35. On 2/25, I summoned the same service for the same trip and was quoted $58. The driver said the trip was 14 miles. I said to follow my normal 7 mile route, which he did and arrived 10 minutes later. I asked Uber to review the charges and refund the obvious erroneous overcharge. They said the fees are final because they are within the estimate. I asked them to explain why the estimate was over 50% higher than the same trip from three days ago. They declined to make any adjustment, basically saying, ""We told you we were going to screw you and we did, so stop bothering us."""

I have been waiting for my $19.85 since February 7th! I have called your customer service office SEVERAL TIMES only to get the runaround. My last time calling was yesterday and I was told that the money would be in my account today, IT IS NOT IN MY ACCOUNT!!! The issue started on February 7th, when I tried to cash out via instant pay. For whatever reason, the money did not go to my bank. I was told that the amount would be deposited into my account during the following weekly deposit. It wasn’t. I am sick of calling your customer service representatives, that apparently have no clue of what they are doing and do not have access to real information. I would just like to receive my money that I am owed without getting the runaround and generic excuses!!

I called Uber for a ride from my home to my job and before I reached my destination, my upfront fare price almost doubled. I went online the same day and requested an explanation. Of course, they couldn't explained it, so they gave me my money back. A month later, the same thing happened to me. I called Uber from O'hare airport to my home, and this time, I screenshot the upfront price because at this point, I can't trust the company due to my previous experience. Sure enough, while I was already in Uber, my upfront price changed from $28.20 to $52.22. 
I reached out to Uber, they came back to say they were correct. I say no, and I sent them a picture of the screenshot showing my upfront price. But they are refusing to give me my money back. I had to file a dispute against them with my Bank. Mind you, Uber is willing to give me back 25% of ""$52.22"". I totally refused. Then came back to say they will give me 50% of $52.22 to which I did not agree either. They are not admitting their wrongdoing even after I sent them a proof to show my upfront price. Uber has a control of its customers bank account, they can go and make a false claim and they get to take your $$$$. I don't understand. They are willing to lose a customer over $5.00? Providing they said they will give me back $19.00 dollars, why $19? They owe me $24 and not $19 which I have yet to see in my bank account. What a shame!

Speaking as a driver for almost two years, as well as a customer for even longer. Uber by far has the worst customer service experiences. That is as a driver and customer. Avoid Uber at all costs, if you have an issue or report of a wrongful charge on your account, forget about it, you will never see that money again. Uber customer support does not even have a number you can call! Finding the email support line is very difficult, and once you do, you won’t get a response back or even the slightest bit helpful of a response. 
The driver support line is even worse, it sounds like you are speaking with someone who this is their first job ever, while it being outsourced in another country so there is a communication barrier. They will repeat the same thing over and over and over again, providing no other train of thoughts or solutions. Uber is just a rotten company. There are other rideshare companies that care have much better experiences for both drivers and customers, speaking from personal experience. I can truly say I will never be using the god awful company again.

If I could give them a minus 10 star I would. I have used Uber in many occasions. This was by far the worst and still ongoing problem. I recently was in Denver, took Uber to airport as early morning flight. That was January 7th, I was billed $41.58 plus tip. It was originally a hold on my credit card and a charge several days later. On Feb 2nd I was notified that my Uber receipt was updated. Looked at my credit card statement online and saw an identical charge with identical trip number charged to my account almost a month later. Contacted Uber by the app which went to someone in India that claimed they had a glitch in their system and I wasn’t charged for the trip in Jan 7.
Fast forward 2 weeks later, provided bank copy and they refuse to acknowledge that I was charged twice. Keep saying my bank is responsible for removing hold which is clearly a charge not hold. Now turning it over to my bank and going to change from error in charge to fraud. It’s inconvenient to deal with someone in India by message and no phone for a live person. Because of this incident I am taking my business elsewhere and use Lyft. If you want a billing nightmare DONT USE UBER.

I have been using Uber for years but after a bad experience this past Friday I think I’m done. After a two week business trip in Detroit, I arrived back to the DC area and found myself in need for a ride from Dulles Airport to my office in order to get my car and drive home (about 5 miles). I didn’t feel like waiting in line for a cab so I ordered an UberX. Not two seconds (literally two seconds) after hitting confirm my phone rang. I answered and the person on the other line identified himself as my driver and asked where I was. I was stunned to say the least but luckily I was already closing in on my walk to the pickup location. He asked where I was going and I told him the name of my company. He asked “Is that in DC?” To which I told him no, it is in Herndon just a few miles from the airport. He said ok and he’d be right there. 
I hung up and again a literal two seconds went by and he cancelled the trip, I guess because it wasn’t far enough of a drive to make it worth his time. It made me mad that he did that. (I’ve heard from other Uber drivers they’re not supposed to confirm pickup based on your destination - in fact they don’t even know where you’re going until after they confirm pickup in the app.) The worst thing about this is that as soon as he did this the entire pickup confirmation disappeared. I couldn’t give him a bad review for abusing the system or even report this to Uber because it’s almost as if the whole thing never happened. No record was left at all other than the phone number he called from. But wait, it gets better.
I was mad, but still needed to ride so I confirmed another UberX. That guy didn’t cancel on me but now I wish he had. I should preface this narrative by explaining that the politics in Virginia (the state in which I was raised and currently still live) is in turmoil. Our governor, LT. Governor and our attorney general are all in trouble for either racist or sexual incidents. The driver was listening to talk radio which was fine although about 2/3 into the drive the news story was that another victim of alleged sex abuse by the Lt. Governor came up. My driver said “Can I ask you a question? Why don’t women report sex abuse claims right after they happen?” Seriously dude? I’m a woman alone in your car. Why on earth would you ask me that? I don’t know you. 
It got worse from there. He ranted about his political opinion and no joke was borderline yelling at me. I was trying to be diplomatic but I finally told him that I was done talking to him. Thank God we were less than a mile from my office by that point. He dropped me off and popped the trunk without getting out to help me with my bag (which honestly I was glad about - I would have told him I can get my own bag, thanks). I was really upset about the whole thing, but the one star review is a result of how Uber handles these types of situations. I’m not even going to get into how absurd I think it is that customers are rated. I am rated for sitting in the back of car, trying to mind my own business? For real? But back to this specific complaint.
First, there is no phone number to call unless it’s an emergency. That right there should be a red flag about a company. Second, when you do finally figure out how to initiate contact through the app be warned that this communication service seems to be outsourced to another country (likely Asia, based on the names of the representatives). Culturally, I believe that makes a huge difference in how the complaints are handled. I think they’re given a script to follow, with restrictions on what form of amends they will offer. All I wanted was a refund for the $14 fare. That’s it. I felt like that was totally reasonable. Instead they gave me a $7 credit towards my next ride - no refund. 
So basically in order to receive any sort of gesture of apology, I have to use their service again. The thing is that my company will reimburse me for the $14 but that isn’t the point. The driver I had was incredibly unprofessional and getting a little hostile towards the end of my ride. I think a refund for such an inexpensive fare is not a lot to ask. I went back and forth with Uber over the app and after my third attempt to get my point across I was told that my complaint had been reviewed and they were satisfied with how it was handled. Ok then. Glad you’re happy, Uber. That’s what counts in the service industry right?
I would like to add that I tend not to be an entitled person. I get things happen and life isn’t perfect. But I also think in this day and age while technology and companies seem to be advancing faster than ever before, companies should bring their A game to the table and treat their customers well. I survived before Uber and I will continue to survive once they are out of my life. I don’t care that their service is supposedly just to be an app. Once you start putting strangers together in vehicles and making insane amounts of money off of it, you become more than just an app. You are a servicer, so start being accountable. 
It’s companies like this that create a more regulated atmosphere for the rest of us because they can’t just seem to operate by a best practice approach. They operate like it’s the Wild West until Uncle Sam slaps them with whatever violations and fines it can. So thanks again, Uber. Your behavior will result in even more laws for this type of service. Good job. Can’t wait to have more laws on the books.

UBER USED TO BE GOOD. LAST YEAR, they started taking 40% MORE FROM DRIVERS. IN February, 2019, They are taking another 30%. Now when you go out, you make nothing with UBER.

I ordered delivery via UberEats. My order came missing many items and when I called the restaurant they were very apologetic and offered to refund my money. Since I paid via the app I had to contact Uber customer service to request a refund. Not only did Uber refuse to give me a refund, even though the restaurant agreed but they would not even bother telling me why. They simply did not respond to my follow up emails asking why I could not get my $27 back. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never use Uber or Uber Eats again."

A few years ago I purchased the Uber app as advertised using the $20 in case of an emergency for myself due to my situation. I had no transportation and still don’t today. I was at a doctors appointment In Sanford Florida behavioral Center for my depression. The nurse took my blood pressure and pretty much gave me a lecture due to my new high reading. I was able to see the doctor right away due to it being an emergency for having a stroke any second that day. I couldn’t go to the emergency room because I tried to use your app I was looking forward to due to my emergency however it never worked out other than I lost $20 for something I was never able to benefit from due to my situation that shouldn’t have been an issue.

Uber has to be one of the worst services I have ever used.

Scheduled an Uber ride 2 days in advance to get to my airline flight at the airport. When the time approached, the app said to be prepared because pick up would occur at the scheduled time. I stood out in the rain with my bags waiting for the driver. No one showed. The app changed from pick up at the appointed time to pick up ""soon."" After 40 minutes of panicking and trying to contact Uber, I gave up and contacted a taxi company that fortunately was able to pick me up and get me to the airport in time for my flight. The taxi company was small and the owner picked me up himself otherwise I would have lost all the money for my airline tickets and prepaid hotel reservations."

Uber only has online assistance/customer service, that's the first issue. The second issue is their online help never addresses the issue. All I wanted was a password reset. It's been over a year since I used their service because of an issue with a driver. I don't have the old phone to send a screenshot, I don't remember my last 2 trips, only one trip. My email and name should be sufficient and the fact I remember the last one last trip. Then if all of this isn't bad enough it takes them forever to respond, if at all. They have an office in Chicago and for what? Because they are apparently of no use either."

Tried multiple times to download Uber app all day yesterday and I’d enter the info it would ask and would either glitch or freeze. Finally after a few hours I actually got to the final step and went to click the arrow to set up my ride and I got yet another service error and was told to try again later. Emailed Uber and they essentially blamed my WiFi and service provider however when I was having the initial issues I had contacted both of them. Uber wanted screenshots, which I didn’t have, but was able to re-Install the app and try again and got the same “error” message. Sent off to Uber. They weren’t much help. 
Very disappointed because Uber was the most recommended and it never worked. Took me 5 mins to install Lyft and had my ride in 7. Way easier to use compared to Uber. I won’t be using Uber now, I’m a dedicated Lyft user now, but these issues need resolved for any new or returning Uber customers. Very disappointed in the service as well as the half-assed response of “looking into it” when you know it won’t be. Shame on you Uber.

I have been trying to drive for Uber now for 4 weeks. The funny part is my girlfriend who is of a different ethnic background was approved within a week with my same car, my same insurance and a worse driving record. However I am getting the runaround for weeks with the same car and information and a much better driver record and I believe that I'm being treated this way because of my nationality. The customer service representatives for Uber played games and sent me multiple email links that took me back to the same page that did not help and I had to call four times in order to still not be active as a driver. I believe they give these Representatives too much power and they need to correct the situation before the situation corrects itself."

I could not post this without selecting an experience rating so I entered one. If I could select minus 5 stars I would. I drove Uber for over two months. I was not paid. Uber owes me over $600.00 and will not pay. When I contacted customer service they stated the money should be in my account within 72 hours. I contacted customer service when payment was not received. They stated that the banking information was not correct. Even though the banking information was already entered I added it again. Money was not received. Called customer service and they stated that the bank information was not correct. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told there was no supervisor. 
Entered bank information again hoping for the best. When money was not received I contacted customer service. They stated that the banking information was not there. I took a screenshot of the partner's Uber banking link with my information. Sent to customer service. They responded that the banking information was not there. Again I asked for a supervisor. I was told that there is no supervisor. Through further telephone communications I again sent a screenshot showing that my information was entered properly. I have been beaten into submission. I am tired of contacting customer support and getting no resolution. I cannot understand why Uber does not have a way to escalate a problem. Uber does not need my money.

I have been driving for Uber for 4 weeks (to earn a extra money on weekends). After 3 weeks of not receiving my pay and numerous contacts to Uber partner help - I have received a customer service message that “due to security issue with my account” I must contact and reinput my banking information.” Which of course I did through the app from my iPad. The message was again that I had security issues. 
Finally after speaking to an Uber support representative, they tell me the security issue due to me signing in from “several devices” and that this is not advised and I should have only been signing in from one device (my phone only). NOTHING in Uber says this and I use multiple devices to check my account information (phone, iPad and computer). Now they tell me I have to drive 1 hour away to verify my identity and they have limited hours (weekdays 11-4 pm only) in Philadelphia - when I’m 40 miles away & I work a regular full time job during the week!!!

I paid $24.99 for a Ride Pass because it offers ""Weather protection"" so that you pay a consistent price for each route you take regardless of rain or time of day, or so Uber states. My route to work and back started out at $10.49 each way. After a bit Uber began charging me $4.00 more to go home from work. When the snow and cold came I was getting charged well over $20.00 one way. When I asked Uber about this they replied: ""With your Ride Pass, you'll pay a consistent price for each route you take. Periods of high demand may impact the price of your trip, but we'll always give you the lowest price."" This in itself is contradictory. How can you pay a consistent price for each route if the price can be jacked up at Uber's discretion? The claim of Weather protection and protection regardless of time of day is nothing more than a bogus promise by Uber and a way to scam you out of $24.99."

I've been doing Uber Eats part time now for over a year. This complaint is about Support, payment of promotions. You will get promos via text message. This last week I decided to take them up on a 3.00 extra charge for each delivery between 11 AM and 2 PM on Sunday Jan 20th. The text reads ""Uber Eats: Today earn an extra 3.00 for every delivery completed between 11 AM and 2 PM "" I got out there at 11 AM and received 4 delivery notices, I completed them, and ended my deliveries at 1:15 as no more calls for my services were needed. I went home and calculated my fees and was short 12.00 for the promotions.
I went to Support and got the runaround. After 9 emails today citing I didn't qualify as I had not driven during the promo hours I would not get the extra fees of 3.00 per delivery. I am considering that since each person I spoke with was foreign, using American names, that maybe the time zones played factor in all this (sarcastic humor). I even sent screenshots of my time on the road according to my Uber Dashboard and the promo sent to my phone via an Atlanta number that Support verified as being legitimate. I am very disappointed. This is not the first time they have taken my pay away after owing me.

This complaint is about the company Uber & their customer support, not a driver. I requested an Uber back in late October after a large fundraising Halloween party got out. My phone unfortunately died from the cold air while the driver was on their way, but I knew the car make/model and the estimated time so I waited since I know that even if a phone dies the trip still goes through. After waiting for a while in the cold, no Uber showed. I waited right out front looking into every car that showed, even asking if they were there for me, and didn't have any luck. 
Eventually my sister had to call another Uber on her phone so we could get out of the cold. The next morning I noticed a charge, which I figured they recorded me as a no show even though I was there. Upon further investigation, it looks like the Uber driver actually gave someone else a ride and charged ME (I could see the trip route they took). The drive must have realized and reported the mistake. This then immediately deactivated my account while they looked into it. It has now been 3 MONTHS, and I am stuck in Uber customer service hell. 
The only place you can talk to a live person is Twitter, and all they tell you is ""we're looking into it"". I submitted a customer support ticket back on the first day this all happened, and the rep I was assigned (mind you it took 2+ weeks after the deactivation to get a rep) called me only once while I was in an appointment, and since then I have spent months leaving her messages and replying to my support ticket with zero response. No one will get back to me and it is completely unprofessional that there is no live person to actually handle these claims in a legitimate way. I know people that have gotten sick in Ubers and their accounts were not deactivated, so this is ridiculous business practice. All I can say is they're just forcing people to try their competitors and like them more with this type of behavior!

If you need help, real support from Uber on their website, don't bother looking. It doesn't exist. No ""Contact Us"" or an email address or phone number. You do get directed to their Twitter feed where you can write in your question which is absurd on its face as I have never ever seen a company handle support in this way. And, you have to join Twitter just to do even this. I hate Twitter and find it stupid and useless which is why I used it for a few months years ago and deleted my account. And since I won't rejoin Twitter I cannot get in touch with Uber. 
Their website has function problems galore in that it takes you to pages you didn't ask to go to then you can't get off of them without logging out and logging in again. My login page tells me my phone number and email are already being used on another account and can't be used again. That account happens to be mine, the only one I ever signed up with. And of course, I cannot get in touch with them because they do not give any information to allow you to do this. The drivers and cars have been good when I used them, but the company sucks and is run badly, and purposely blocks anyone from contacting them. I'll just call a taxi from now on.

My first issue came when my payments were declined and called fraud because I didn't set my pickup point at my exact address, but instead at a more convenient pick up spot for myself and the driver. Managed to solve this issue. The next issue, I attempted to purchase Uber credit, to be declined. My bank had cash in it, but refuses to accept payment. Furthermore, according to them, I still owe a $1.03 balance for some reason. Speaking of, why am I paying .03 for every dollar I give as a tip?

Most of the time the address takes me to the back of the building I ask to go. Also this new Uber pool walking thing in the middle of winter is a horrible idea. The whole point of us using Uber instead of riding buses is so that we can get dropped off and picked up at our door not walk two blocks in the cold. And you shouldn't have to pay extra just to avoid walking, I've had drivers cancel either way so we were better off without that update.

As a new sign up, I was advised that once I complete 60 rides I will be given an additional $350 dollars as a bonus. This was not the case. Apparently the agent explaining the details missed to clarify that $350 dollars are guaranteed for the first 60 rides. In other words, if the total for the rides do not add up to $350 dollars, they will pay the difference.
Second and most important, Uber makes 25% of the driver's earnings, but forget to mention that they keep the full booking fees. So on one of my weekly payments, they made $ 220 dollars when I made $ 400 dollars. In reality, they have taken 45% of the total fee...and I still have to pay tax. I am no longer driving for Uber, I do not recommend for any one to drive for Uber. If Lyft is the same, then it is time for a truly professional company that look after the driver and the rider. Uber is not worth the time or the effort. It is a complete waste of time.

I’m going on day two of being an Uber driver and I hate it. Uber pays you less to do long distance drives and they don’t follow through with their promises. Before I get into that my biggest complaint is the navigation system. It’s inaccurate and very slow. They try to blame your phone service but if it were my service then my maps on my phone or the Waze app (which is what I use on the daily) would glitch out as well.
My next complaint is the map always tries to redirect you to the Sam Houston toll hwy. When I called to ask about this, I was talked over for 10 minutes and received nothing but a “we aren’t responsible for tolls”. The only tolls they will reimburse are the tolls collected going to the person's house. I don’t know about other people, but I’m doing this to get money. I already have to spend money on gas and they don’t help you with that, I don’t have $5+ to drop on tolls every trip. Last night I had about 8 different trips that wanted me to take the toll roads.
My next issue is I took a trip that said I’d get at least $9 for the trip. I drove 20 minutes to drop this lady her food off and only got $5 for the trip. Then when I contacted them they told me to screenshot every trip before I go on it and that I’m sol. My final complaint is the app promised me that my money would be sent to my bank account TODAY on the 13th. But when I contacted them they said I won’t get my money until Friday. That’s a full week away. I’m pissed because I did take a screenshot this time because I realize they are untrustworthy and that still means nothing. I wouldn’t suggest anyone do Uber. Check out DoorDash or something like that because it isn’t worth the hassle.

But what really broke the straw was yesterday I drive in Chicago and have to do Uber pool rides, a rider complained about there was 4 people in my car! So she was first rider then 2 people jumped in and pick up 1 more person. I apologized for the inconvenience, I was very kind and social, the ride gave me 1 star because of something I have no control over how many riders in my car.
I called UBER SUPPORT - they were useless and blamed me for the low rating. The new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi does not know or care about the Uber drivers at all. The rating system is so unfair you have to have 4.6 or your deactivated and rider can rate you low for anything. Pay is bad and service is bad. I would say only drive UBER if you have absolutely no other job or income and this is last means to make money, I'm serious take it from a veteran driver. My experience driving Uber is horrible.

I have used Uber for a while now frequently during the week. Recently, upon returning from a two week holiday, I get back to business as usual and my usual route has a price hike from $12.50/$13 to a whopping $27.98 for an UberX. Also, two days in a row I’ve been charged more than the price shown for the same route I’ve been taking for months! Uber May be fine for “New Users“ and folks that aren’t frequent riders. Otherwise, prepare to be ripped off. I'm done with them. They lost my business."

Uber is the worst service provider ever. I booked a cab from Yeshwantput to Marathalli which cost 320-350 RS. The driver stopped the cab after few min in a highway and said he cannot go any further as the mode of payment was online and he doesn't have the money to put petrol. The trip cost me 80 RS and after then when I booked another cab I had to pay 550 so in total I had to pay more than 600 rs. I want to know who will pay the extra charge that I had to bear."

I have had some very positive experiences with Uber, but two experiences were terrible. The first bad experience I had was a driver criticized me for not being able to drive myself. The second happened this morning (1/6/19). I had ordered an Uber at 7:02 a.m. and saw that the driver was only six minutes away which would've been more than enough time to get me to work at 7:30. I kept an eye on my Uber app to see how close the driver was and noticed at 7:10 they were about a block away. I waited in front of my house for 22 minutes and when I saw they hadn't moved since 7:10 I was forced to cancel my ride and call a taxi. Not only was I 15 minutes late to my job, but I was also charged a cancelation fee."

I have had it where an Uber driver has canceled a trip and then the payment is reversed but the next payment is a higher fee which they do not show until after the trip has ended. I have also had it where they have charged me twice for the same trip or added a penalty that should not have been there."

Girlfriend ask me to send her an Uber, so l ordered the economic or pool which US$3.30. l provided the exact address of my girlfriend which was going to ride to my apt. Well after a while UBER sent me a text that the ride was canceled by driver, and also to try one more time with another driver. Well l tried, so finally succeed, but the driver could not find the address l provided. He went to another address, but finally reached the destination provided. l called the driver and he told me that he was sent to another address, but the address l provided was accurate. But as l said before, finally reached my girlfriend and brought her to her destination. 
What l was not expecting was the Uber charged me US$5.0 for the drive which the driver canceled, 3.30 for the one he pick my girlfriend, and 3.30 because the driver went to another address. And when finally l checked the app in my cell still the ride was on 10 mins after the driver drop off my girlfriend, so l proceed to cancel it because it was already done. And for my biggest surprise it also charged me 3.30 after l canceled the same ride that my girlfriend did. 
In total on a 3.30 ride l ended up paying US$14.9 which mean that UBER JUST RIPPED ME OFF US$11.6 EXTRA. That is how economic UBER IS, I imagine if l would have ordered a platinum service. What happen is that Uber drivers cancel the ride even is the exact address because when they cancel the ride stating that the driver did not find the address, they charge the ride to clients anyway, that is a ripoff. l cancel my account with them and l going to my credit card to claim that money for service l did not received.

I just had my second experience with Uber doubling my fare. The quoted fare was MX $73 pesos and I was charged MX $148.99. A taxi to my destination, which I go regularly, is MX $80. I would never get in a cab without confirming the fare, or buy an airline ticket. Why would Uber expect me to do that? For the fare to be over DOUBLE the quote is criminal. Why would I continue to use Uber if their rates are double that of a taxi?"

I have used Uber to get to and from places and generally have never had any issues. During certain nights, events or holidays they, as well as other companies, are known to increase the price of transport. For example, the general price to and from my house to downtown is $18 but they increased the price to $30 on New Year's of 2017-2018. That was annoying because they knew that many people would be vulnerable at 2-3 am and willing to pay that amount to get home. It was frustrating but doable, especially if you were lucky enough to find a buddy to split it with. However, this New Year's (2018-2019) Uber began adding surge charges in the beginning of events, thus I was charged about $30 to get to the event and then they had the audacity to increase the surge charge to $98 for the return trip! $98! Almost $100 to be driven 15 to 20 min. away. That is beyond ridiculous. 
It resulted in hundreds of drunk adults wandering the streets after everything had closed because they literally could not afford to go home. I had strangers coming up to me and asking if I was headed in the same direction so that we could split the cost. Normally an hour or so after the event ends, the price will drop a little but at 3 am the price went from $98 to $97. I don’t know how that is legal but that is a disgusting way to take advantage of others. It was increased so drastically that it was enough to make anyone question whether they were truly sober enough to drive, even at the risk of getting a DUI. I was fortunate enough to find other means of transportation & avoid paying that absurd amount but never again will I put myself in that situation where I am relying on Uber to get home and am stuck somewhere full of drunk people after 2 am because I chose to drink therefore not take my car.

1st Trip on 31 December 2018 @ 16:30 - Trip Number: 2nd Trip on 1 January 2019 @ 03:00 - Trip Number: 1st Trip from home at 7 ** Street, Winchester Hills to ** Mount Street, Bryanston. Driver: Xolani Passengers: two Cost of Trip = R275. Trip cost was shown before accepting the Uber ride. 2nd Trip from ** Mount Street, Bryanston Driver: Peter Passengers: two Cost of Trip (Charged Twice) 1st Charge R863.00 2nd Charge R865.0 15 Minutes after arriving home, the R863.00 was reversed. Trip cost was not shown before accepting the Uber Ride.
This is our complaint: The driver, Peter was around the corner and we walked to meet him outside the gate that was about 0.750 meters away. The app at no point displayed the charges or surcharges to be applied - we had no idea that this was even a possibility. We would have never taken the drive and would have waited if we were informed. The driver was either drunk or sleepy as he kept veering off the road and into other lanes. Customers should not be charged more if it’s the company that is suffering from short services. 
2nd charge was higher as well. Cost of the trip “unbeknownst” was more than triple the amount. The charges going from home to ** Mount street was displayed as what it would cost us for New Years Eve trip. Why was the New Year's day trip more than 3 times the charge? It does NOT make any sense. We would have gotten Taxify instead if we were notified of the surcharge. We had a problem similar on November 9th. The issue was never resolved when we went through the Uber Help. The app displayed a price, but their charge was almost double. Please assist with resolving this issue as Uber South Africa is not interested in resolving or assisting with matters before.

Uber is a great business idea, in theory. Employ ambitious people willing to provide a cheap taxi service using their own vehicles for those brave souls willing to get into a stranger's messy car with the expectation of getting to their destination alive and in one piece for an agreeable price. Less costly than a limo, and far better than collecting returnable cans and bottles from the roadside for those seeking easy cash income. Win-win, right? Not so fast. Without delving into the obvious, the possibility of slipping into the back seat of a serial killer or the rolling annex of a hoarder's hovel, allow me to address the drivers here, who have only recently been permitted to receive and expect a TIP from their passengers, in addition to their 70% share of the cost of an Uber ride from their (yes, brave) fares.
Pay attention, Patel, for I am only going to say this once. When you see gray heads flagging you down at the passenger pickup at the airport, and those seniors are hauling luggage, no matter how small and light, step OUT of your Camry and load those parcels into your trunk YOURSELF, instead of sitting there like an impatient camel jockey while Mr. and Mrs. GotRocks hoist their own bags. Older folks who travel have MONEY and are your prime tipping prospects. These are not drunken bar ** hailing a ride home from the club. And when you deliver those gray-haired walking wallets to their luxurious suburban homes, trot your lazy ** out of the car to unload their luggage for them. Carry it a few yards to the front door, if you have to. If you make me play bellboy on either end of my journey with my bags, you are going to not only starve for a tip but suffer a mediocre (at best) review of my Uber ""experience"".
I know what it is to serve the public, having put my younger self through college as a bartender. And I know enough to tip in cash when it is EARNED. Just this evening, the lady and I returned home from a very exhausting trip covering 12 hours and thousands of miles, and the fool driving for Uber sat in his car and popped the trunk in the chaotic pickup lane at JFK while we wrestled with our luggage, hoping the next car along did not smash into us while Mr. Uber driver continued to chat on his cellphone from the comfort of the driver's seat. Did I leave this lazy amateur a tip? Heck no, I did not. He was gone and out of my driveway before we even made it to the front door, and I hope he enjoys his 2-star rating. He surely earned it.

On Tuesday December 24, 2018 at about 5:37 am I opened the Uber app on my tablet and immediately confirmed a pick for $13.92 (pool). The car came by at about 5:39/5:40 am. Slowed down as I was approaching, sped off about a block, slowed down again and did a u-turn to the opposite side of the street. All this time I began running after it. I caught it at the stop light, opened the door and got in. He claimed he did not see me coming after him. This was strange, the street was empty, early morning and with my hands waving I was unseen? God bless there was the stop light that have him came to a complete stop.
He dropped me off the corner on the back of the street I was working on. When I settled down to check the app to give a rating I noticed the fare was $24.93. I have been contacting Uber and they are insisting that was the fare that showed up. From since I have been taking the Uber pool never had to paid that fare going or coming. I don’t understand what is going on at Uber. I am so disappointed because these people don’t know how to treat the few of us who have been loyal keeping them in business.

A couple of weeks ago I ordered an Uber, and got connected to one a couple of kilometers away. He calls, confirms my location and says he will be there in a couple of minutes, fine and dandy. 10 minutes have passed and no sign of him, I try to call again, his phone is switched off, with the app still running on my phone. Since I waited over 5 minutes to cancel the trip, I am charged with a cancellation fee, even though it's not my fault whatsoever!
I let bygones be bygones and move on with life.
This morning I tried to order an Uber once again. At 8:15am I requested one, showed he was 10 minutes away on the app, however I can see the car moving further and further away. I try call the driver, no answer. Maybe he is dealing with a customer or unable to talk, I get it. 5 minutes pass, I try catch him again, no answer and then he proceeds to cancel my trip. Get another driver, try call him, no answer once again. 3rd time us the charm right? I request another driver, this one at least picks up, but says that he is out of the 3km pickup radius (I was approximately 5 km away), and does not see the point of driving all the way to pick me up (it's a large private residential estate, I highly doubt there are any Ubers within the 3km radius either way, but he hung up. 
By now it's 8:50am, and I decide to use a competitors app, Taxify Kenya, they had a driver in the same area as the last one, he says since it's so early on a Saturday morning there should be no traffic and is at the pickup location within 10 minutes. Due to Uber I was late by 40 minutes to my destination, all because the drivers are not in the mood to do their pickups. I am very disappointed, irritated and most definitely will not be using the Uber app in Kenya as my go to taxi app any longer.

I requested a driver to take me about 25 miles. The stated fare was $42.07...reasonable for the long distance, and I have a pass which discounts the trip afterwards. I watched on the app as the assigned car drove around about 3 miles away...then received a request to rate my trip, all within about 5 min of requesting the 25 mile trip. I figured the driver must have cancelled or something and requested a new trip. The second driver came and drove me to the requested destination. Same distance, same stated fare, no problem. I noticed later that I had been charged for both trips though. I know mistakes happen, so just messaged Uber to request that they refund the trip that did not occur. 
They replied that the trip had been completed as requested...despite the fact that the driver never came within 3 miles of the requested pickup, that the trip he reported was 1 mile and the requested trip was 25 miles. I replied that it was ridiculous to believe that the 1 mile trip was 'as requested', since I had been quoted $42 for the trip, and more importantly...the driver never picked me up, so it could not have been 'completed' as requested or otherwise. Again customer service insisted that the trip was completed as requested. The third time I asserted that they could not charge me for a trip that they did not pick me up for, someone replied that 'oh, maybe someone else took the trip you requested'...which is fine. I know mistakes can happen, but I am still angry that they insisted twice that the charge was valid. 
I did eventually receive a refund for what I had been charged for the non-existent trip, but still have not seen the trip returned to my pass, so am still out the $40 to use on another trip. They also do not have a good system for drivers claiming wait times...I do everything I can to tell the driver exactly where I am, and more often than not the driver will pull up a block away and on the other side of the street and just wait...of which I am charged some amount of money as a 'wait fee'. The wait fee makes sense if the driver really has to wait for the customer to arrive at the pickup point, but if I put in 123 main street and say 'I’m under the sign for the 123 Diner', and the driver stops at 150 main street and starts his meter...that is pretty unfair to me, especially if I'm standing in the cold waiting, to make sure he/she doesn't have to wait for me.

When I scheduled Uber to pick me up at 6AM and take me to the airport, the instructions I received stated that the driver would arrive between 6 and 6:10, and I would be charged every minute I was late. The driver arrived at 6am, I walk out at 6:05 only to find that the driver left!!! Luckily, I had a car and there was enough time to drive to the airport and park my car. Otherwise, I would've have missed my flight!
The SAME WEEK, I scheduled another Uber pick up. The driver was approaching my location and had stopped in the middle of the road, 3 lanes away from me! I wasn't sure if it was Uber and I could NOT see his license plate because he was facing me and had no way to verify it was Uber before jumping in the car. He rolled down his window, and I asked, ""Are you Uber?"" He slightly nodded so I still wasn't sure. I asked, ""Are you going to drive over to me?"" (I wasn't about to cross 3 lanes and hop in a car in the middle of the road. That's just common sense as it does not seem like a safe thing to do. Not to mention that I had no way to verify if it was Uber!) He then rolled his eyes and drove away. As he drove away, I saw his license plate and realized it was Uber. He then canceled my trip and I am the one who was charged!?? Really? 
I finally figure out how to get a ""refund"" except it's a credit and NOT a refund. I am now trying to figure out how to get my money back aka REFUND! Uber makes it so difficult, one has to question whether they purposely do that in hopes that people will just give up. Potentially one million frustrated people - who ""give up"" trying to figure it out; after all it's ""only $7"", right? But multiply 1 million by $7, that's a lot of money paid to a corporation who never provided a service. Even worse, money paid to a corporation who also made the client worse off than client would have been had Uber never allowed such behavior to occur in the first place!

I have been riding Uber premier cars for the past 2-years in various Indian cities. What I have seen is that the 100% of Indian Uber drivers as all the other taxi drivers in the country do not close their windows and use air-conditioning or heater (in winter) when they are not on a trip with their riders. The Uber drivers thus maintain a filthy interior with dusts of all kinds on all the cars along with mosquitoes freely 'roaming' inside the cars. 
The Uber drivers of India are specialists of mosquitoes breeding and I've always wondered as to how these drivers are immune to this menace! Uber India did not implement a rule that ensures clean interior to the riders but charges their customers exorbitantly all the time. Uber India offers its riders the filthy cars for all in the country. Why not Uber headquarters in the U.S instruct their Indian counterpart on maintaining clean cars without mosquitoes please? The drivers of Uber Premium cars must always close their windows of their car so that the interior is always clean.

The driver submitted pictures taken from someone else's ride, and claimed the mess was made by him and his girlfriend. He contacted Uber to refute these charges, and told them to check the date and time on the picture. Uber said they didn't have that information. Apparently they believe whatever their drivers tell them. He went back and forth with Uber. Finally, I sent an email and told them the driver would have that info, and we would seek legal counsel if necessary. They soon refunded his money. On a Google search, I found out many Uber drivers do this. They often set up their car to show a mess, use the same pictures over and over again, and even have a bank of ""messy car"" pictures they submit. My advice - take pictures of the inside of the car before you leave."

It always shows as 5 min for arrival before booking the cab. As soon you I book the cab it takes 15-20 mins for the arrival. It still shows 12 mins arrival. You will not get to cancel the ride even because they charge cancellation fee for that. Always it has been a Worst experience."

Buyer beware! Do not buy an Uber gift card. I received one as a gift, and tried to use it to take a trip with Uber. The card did not work. I have sent 25 requests to Uber customer service, and have been told 25 times that Uber cannot apply gift cards to rides and they do not issue refunds. Please do not buy an Uber gift card! Uber customer service does not help with gift card issues. The only way to contact Uber customer service is through the app. They do not have a phone number."

I needed to grab a ride in pouring rain for 3-4 blocks. I'd been given a code for discount ride that was never credited. Then found another charge of $40 on my card. When I made a complaint their answer was I had made a mess requiring cleaning. First off there is no way I'd made a mess with 1 small bag and just sitting there. And if I got seat wet, well it's pouring rain! I could of gotten entire car cleaned for that much. I'm handicapped and on a fixed income. This extra fee causes a hardship and actually takes food from my table. I've used this company for years and have had good and bad but this is robbing me and taking advantage of a trust with my bank info. Company cannot be trusted."

I schedule two Ubers for a trip to the airport for a group of 6. The first Uber arrived and took half of the group. The second Uber was late. As per their policy, I was credited $10 for being late. I could see the Uber coming up the street, then turn around and cancel us. He said he had car trouble. My guess is he had just been notified he lost $10 for running late and decided not to complete the ride. There were no other rides available for more than an hour. We had to drive ourselves and pay for parking for the entire trip, plus pay for the additional Uber which we would not have needed if I knew we were driving ourselves. Uber just sent a canned response/apology. Unacceptable service!"

I was in the middle of my ride, maybe not even the middle 1/4 of the way to my destination and realized I can should switch my destination to another closer location. To edit your location, you have to click the search icon and edit your destination. Cool, However it wouldn’t let me. Inside the part where the search icon is and on top of that was a location symbol. Basically means you can’t change it. The location you picked is where you’re going. I figured this can’t be right and starting trying to get answers in why, I cannot change it. I was so furious!!! But because I selected a CHEAPER ride like Uber pool which makes total sense because it’s CHEAPER!!! But Uber won’t allow you to change it, if you selected Uber pool. Ok, I don’t get it.
Why can’t we? Because other possible riders are around the area and you don’t want to change up the location or the length but I’m the one paying for the service, it shouldn’t matter what type of Uber service you get, if you need to change your location you should be able to. Terrible terrible system they have. Like what if you have an emergency and need to change destination mid drive but you can’t. Am I suppose to cancel ride mid ride and then get out the car and deselect my location and wait and get a new driver!!! Unbelievable!!!

Their price is too high compared to Lyft so I stopped using Uber.

Headed to the airport, Uber asks me to confirm my phone number. I do, and they ask me to enter a 4 digit code that I never receive. I contact customer support via the app (there is no phone number), and they ask for my phone number, a screenshot of my phone number, and my last few trips. They contact me almost 2 hours after submitting these details to ask for these 3 details again. I sent this info again, and they reply with a similar message. I type everything out and take new screenshots of everything, and they once again ask me for my phone number. I finally ask, ""Is there any way I can continue using your app, or do I have to use a competitor going forward?"" 20 hours passes. No answer. All I want to do is use the app, all of my info is the same, and has never changed."

The response to my email to Uber Eats is unacceptable. I sent the below email to Uber Eats customer service...their response was basically a slap in the face.
“Hi, I would like a credit for the inconvenience my colleagues and students had to go through, as well as myself. I scheduled and placed this order at 8:30pm, for delivery between 10pm-10:30pm. At 11:00pm it was still pending, so we got food for our kids from somewhere else. At 12:20am, I just received a message that the order was accepted and is being delivered. This is unacceptable, as we had to spend $120 on room service due to the fact we could not reach the restaurant or Uber Eats and our students had to eat.
Not only am I disappointed in the lack of a customer service number that is NOT easily available, I never heard from anyone about our order. This caused stress beyond measure, which makes me question whether or not we will continue to use your service. Uber Eats just provided us the WORST experience ever tonight. Because of the undue stress, extra money, and time, I think a credit is due. Can you please review this order and process accordingly. Thank you.”

After an hour of waiting for our food, Uber tracking online said it was delivered but no food. Contacted the restaurant, they said not their problem but did give us the driver mobile number, We rang the driver, and she said that she couldn't find the address so she binned it. Submitted a complaint via Uber forms and no response. We will no longer use Uber Eats... It's a pity because the Uber taxi is a good service but I may need to cancel my account in protest."

I haven't used Uber in a couple of years. I was recently asked by my employer to activate Uber for business and link my personal account. The last time I attempted to log in to the Uber app, it wouldn't accept my password. I attempted to reset it, but never received the verification texts they sent me so I could not. I have since gotten new phone number and so I had no way to receive their verification texts. I contacted customer service and they responded with a generic reply asking for the same information I sent them in the help form. I replied giving them this information again and explaining that I could not get the verification texts so I could not reset my password. They asked me to provide a screenshot of the phone number on my phone, which I did, and then they replied saying it didn't match their records. Of course it didn't match their records! I already told them that. 
I replied once again explaining that I did not have access to the phone number I had originally signed up with. Again, they replied with the same generic form response as their first response. I replied a couple more times and each time they sent the same generic form response. This is some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will be uninstalling the Uber app from my phone and I will never use their service again.

I am out of $70 bus fare with Uber basically offering no help or a solution. I was unable to spend for another ticket which leaves my mother to go home without care upon her discharge.

I am a regular user of Uber cabs from the moment it was introduced in Hyderabad. I never had major issues with the services and I am happy to be using their hassle free services except for the Uber ride services. I have been using Uber ride pass since September 4 2018 and for the month of November this would be 3rd time of opting the Uber ride pass services for the year 2018. Since September 2018 the Uber ride pass flat fare is made applied along with overage on 90% of my rides during September and October 2018 rides. During one such ride, the fare was calculated wrongly and extra amount was charged instead of the actual amount which was shown before confirming the ride. 
On contacting the support services they have confirmed that extra was charged and reversed the entire overage amount. The fare was adjusted to the flat fare on that specific ride instead of actual amount which was shown to me before the ride. I was confused and tried analyzing the reason for reversing the overage amount and adjusting to flat fare instead of actual amount shown. I tried to contact the customer support in this regard, and tried for other rides raising that the trip fare was charged more than the applicable flat fare. I immediately got response and the extra overage amount which was collected has been reversed as Uber credits to me for a travel which was taken in the month of September 2018.
I therefore, raised concerns for all my rides taken since September 2018 till date that the Uber ride pass flat rate was not made applicable. From 04.09.2018 to 17.11.2018 all the rides I have taken and one ride on 19.11.2017 for which concern was raised have been adjusted to flat fare. The rides which were taken from 19.11.2018 are being rejected and the fare is not adjusted. My question is the fare adjusted to flat fare for the earlier taken for almost 2.5 months and why am I rejected the same benefit. On contacting the support team, they are giving a ready-made copy paste answer or recorded message sought of a thing without actually going through my concern or without trying to understand my issue. 
I am fed up with the continuous message I have been sending and the robotic replies I have got. The representatives at Support are not trying to understand my concern which is very simple. If they wanted to apply the rules then they should have done the same at the time of first reversal when the ride amount was adjusted to flat fare. If that was fair enough then you should practice the same for all my travels. Is it too much to expect a simple answer to my simple question. It’s a humble request to whoever is on the top of the support system to look into my concern and provide a proper resolution to my concern.

I have been using Uber for YEARS and use it often, I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on Uber, I am DONE. Uber does not screen their drivers anymore, drivers are rude or don't speak English which is the primary language where I live which makes it hard to communicate if need be, they do not check into the quality of the cars and I know this because I had a friend who has never used Uber sign up to be a driver and was approved after I had been picked up by more than 1 car with no ac and/or had some type of mechanical problem. 
The ""customer service"" department with their same automated messages that basically all say their driver did nothing wrong or ""things happen"" is more infuriating than anything to deal with. The quality of this whole company is just ridiculous. The change in the quality of service and people has become very apparent since there is no sign up fee to be a driver and literally ANYONE can now drive for Uber, luckily other ride share companies are becoming more popular and there are now more options.

I've been through so much with this app and it's only negative. I've had so much patience trying to deal with this company but nothing gets resolved except Uber taking my money. I bought $75 in Uber gift cards to get a $72 ride. They didn't allow me to use the gift cards and asked me to add a card. I followed instructions to do so. I had an active card but it kept asking me to update my billing settings. I KNOW everything was correct. For HOURS I WAITED IN THE COLD trying to figure out how to get one ride.
I was so set on using Uber because I had added the gift cards to my account and they aren't refundable. That was my biggest mistake. I tried to call. Uber has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER to help at all. This is simply just a terrible business. I angrily downloaded Lyft because I didn't want to spend ANOTHER $75 on rides and got my ride within the first 5 minutes of opening the app and creating an account. After all is said and done, Uber took my money and Lyft was so simple to use. UBER IS TERRIBLE AND THEY STEAL YOUR MONEY.

I’ve been an Uber driver for over two years and despite my one star rating there are a lot of things I love about driving for Uber, and none of them have to do with the actual company. The things I like for instance meeting new people and seeing new sites have to do with industry itself and the fact that most people are generally nice. 
The company continues to alter the pay system and at each step the drivers make smaller and smaller percentages. There’s never anyone to talk to unless you call their overseas call lines who have zero authority to actually help. They don’t improve their system regardless of complaints from drivers regarding flaws. Amount other things I just don’t have time to go into, they don’t correct pay mistakes in most instances that clearly call for compensation. All in all, the idea of ridesharing is great and the most greedy people have cornered the market and clearly couldn’t care less for the drivers who make their business possible.

Why ask me to select photos of cars to prove that I am not a bot if I can only ever be talking to one on Uber's end? I switched carriers and got a new phone with a new number, which rendered me unable to sign into Uber, because I had no access to the previous phone number for verification codes. I learned there is only one way to reach out to Uber in such situation, through one email link on their website. I was not able to call them as they have made themselves unavailable to that for riders and I could not initiate a chat session with their support because I could not sign in at all, whether the app or the website.
I was provided with answers irrelevant to the issue I wrote about. It became apparent I was dealing with artificial intelligence and no human being read about my issue. I had to send multiple emails trying to reformulate the same thing and I was facing a Berlin wall. I've sent the screenshot from my phone of the new number their bot was asking me for 3 times to no avail, it found a perfectly normal screenshot from my phone not fitting their standards. After 2 days of an exchange I had enough. I finally asked for my Uber account to be deleted. This is only then when a human bothered to read a thing I wrote.

I've read many of the positive reviews and while I have had great drivers with Uber I've also had very bad drivers. It they are bad drivers and you think you can do something to get them removed from Uber think again. That's not going to happen. Probably the worst situation is lack of language skills with Uber drivers around NYC. Here is a case in point. I'm standing in pouring rain. Call an Uber says it will be 5 minutes. 10 minutes later I get a call from the Uber driver in serious broken English which took me about 3 times of asking ""What are you saying?"" 
Finally I figure out he doesn't know where I am. I tell him the cross streets but he doesn't under ""one hundred and sixty third street"" so I try ""1,6,3 street"" after about 10 times of saying this over and over he finds us. Then he charges us for waiting over 2 minutes. REALLY? Outrageous that Uber doesn't even make sure people understand the language(s) used in each specific country or at least hires people that realize their incompetence isn't rewarded by charging the customer more.

This evening I placed an order with Swiss Chalet. Within seconds of submitting my order I realize my business address was selected instead of my home address. I hit the cancel button and my order was canceled instantly. This all happened within less than 10 seconds of confirming my order. I went back into Uber Eats and tried to select a Swiss Chalet with my home address but the restaurant did not come up. Assuming my order was canceled I went on SkipTheDishes and was able to place an order from a different location that was closer to my house. I then looked at my Uber Eats app and realized that they are not refunding my money for my order as they said the restaurant had already begun making the food. 
Is it my fault that when you place an order it’s instant but I assume cancellations take longer. There is no way the food could’ve been prepared in the second between ordering it and canceling it. I assume cancellations are delayed by Uber as there’s no way the food could’ve been prepared in the seconds between ordering it and canceling it. It took me so long to get a hold of customer service representatives at Uber. I was transferred from one department to another that I had finished eating my food that had arrive from SkipTheDishes before I was finally told no they will not be refunding my money. 
The manager at Swiss Chalet on Cross was very good. He has given me a credit to cover the two meals that Uber would not refund. That Uber customer service representative who would not give her name was involved in a conference call with the manager of the Swiss Chalet who told her it was OK to give me back my money but she still refused. I have been using Uber Eats and Uber for many years now and have never cancel an order or lodged a complaint this is pissing me off.

A little over Two weeks ago, I was a rider in an Uber that go into a car accident when it hit a concrete divider in NYC., myself and my friend were injured and required transportation to the Hospital. We both have several injuries that require medical follow up, my friend suffered from a hairline fracture of her skull and Spin, I have several injuries ranging from concussion to neck injuries as well as knee injuries. My Doctor wants me to get follow up care ASAP but to date Uber has not reached out to use to give us any information. We have tried to contact them multiple times and get a RoBo response that they are taking this issue seriously but nobody has contacted us or given us insurance information. This leaves us in a bind in that we cannot make Dr. apt. without the no-fault insurance information."

I have been using Uber for 2 years now. Seemed ok, but recently I was charged for a ride I took months ago (I remembered the amount - 20.04) so I opened the app and looked into trips I've taken and amounts billed. I also checked my Paypal account to verify and double check payments, and Wow I have random charges that do not coincide with rides, I have one account of double billing, and three separate charges for 17.84, 18.84 and 28.46 that have no rides associated with the dates. One was on Christmas day when I know I didn't use that service. I contacted Uber but have yet to hear anything. I cannot find any phone numbers, and the app is not very helpful."

I had a promo on my account for at least a few months now. $5 off ALL rides in Toronto. It applied to Pool and Uber X. It would automatically renew. No issues. All of a sudden almost 2 weeks ago I noticed it was only on the Uber X. So I sent a message. They told me it was only applicable to X. This isn't a new promo code. It's the same. That was always applicable to Pool. You can't just change rules. You need to change the actual promo. I know 2 people who still have it applicable to Pool. After going back and forth for almost a week, now my messages go unanswered. Not even the generic message they send. Straight ignored. And I know they're waiting for the promo to expire which is either today or tomorrow. It's absolutely disgusting to have that kind of service. I've been a rider for 3 years. Took Uber EVERY day. It's a $5 promo. Which other riders still have. Sickened at the way this has been dealt with."

My experience with Uber has been terrible. There is no way to actually get in contact with customer service. I lost my phone in the back of one of their cars the other day. The only way to retrieve a lost item is to speak with your driver, however, my driver didn't speak a word of English. So I'm unable to communicate with him. Despite repeated emails to customer service explaining this, all I'm getting back are automatic reply email, telling me to contact the driver. Bad service. Will not use again."

Yesterday I took 2 Uber, like I typically (if not daily) use. On my uber ride home, everything seemed normal. I had a nice chat with my driver as he dropped me off from a 10 min ride. Hours after, I see my Paypal and Credit card statements, and realize Uber has charged me $150 for a ""Cleaning Fee"". They are suggesting that I made a mess to my drivers car. Apparently, the driver sent them a generic picture of a wet at and charge me $150. Mind you, this extra charge/modification was made some hours after my ride was completed.
This is COMPLETELY FALSE. UBER hasn't been helpful to me at all. They are just flat out cleaning their hands of any involvement and taking the generic picture that was submitted (which could have been taken anywhere) and saying that ""THAT IS THAT"". How am I, as a rider, protected from false driver claims? How are they checking the veracity of these driver claims? I feel that this was an assault! In no moment did the driver or anybody talk to me, the customer, about any situation. Of course they wouldn't since NOTHING happened. Instead I are up to a rude and expensive charge! I do think that situations may arise to a ""Cleaning"" charge policy. But there has to be a better way to deal with both sides of the exchange. I sincerely believe that the drivers are taking advantage of a ""Cleaning Fee"" that is easy to take advantage of. I hope this issue can get resolved in my case and, moreover, in Uber's manner of conducting business.

I've been using Uber for years with no issue. About 6 months ago I started receiving an error message saying 'something went wrong' and could get past the ride search without this error. I contacted customer service via their website form (since you can't email or call anyone to explain your situation). Uber support could not figure out the issue. After 3 weeks of back and forth with the support staff, I had them delete my account and was told I could sign-up with the same email after 30 days. I've since downloaded the app again and cannot sign up using my email or phone number as Uber says it is already in use.
It absolutely amazes me how little help their support staff was and disappointing that they couldn't figure out a simple error message, let alone the deletion or unlocking of an account. Just another example of the ineffectiveness of email support. You would think they would at least have the ability to call you and discuss the issue. Who knows... MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T WANT MY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF BUSINESS PER YEAR! Worst Support Staff I've Ever Experienced.

My initial issue with Uber started back in August 2018. My first attempt at opening an account was on August 2nd after attending a concert with my friend. Keep in mind, this was the FIRST time I have ever opened (or at least tried to open) an Uber account. After I provided the necessary information, I was given a big red error message saying that my account had been disabled. How my account had been disabled even though I never opened an account is beyond me. At any rate, I figured I'd go to the website they provided to reactivate my account. As I'm trying to do that, the request wasn't going through. After multiple attempts I gave up, and I had my friend download it and we were able to get home. 
On 10/26/18, my friends and I went out to a Halloween party and upon trying to get home, I remembered that my attempts to reactivate the account I never even opened weren't successful. At that point, I input my husband's information and again, no success. The next morning, I tried yet again to ""reactivate"" my account. I was told to input my email address (which was what prompted the first warning of a disabled account, so apparently it's already in the system), write a detailed explanation as to the issue at hand, and then follow the instructions sent to my email once I receive them. 
A few minutes later, I received the aforementioned email and proceeded to explain (again) in detail, with screenshots (as they asked), of the issue at hand. And so, I went ahead and did as the email requested, and after hitting ""Send,"" I get an email back, within seconds, that the email I am replying to them from is not the same email I initially used to submit my account reactivation request. I thought to myself, ""Oh, maybe there was a glitch. Let me try again."" So, I tried again, and again, and again, for a total of 4 tries, and each time, I got an email that my request cannot be processed because, ""[We] received this email from a different email address than the one you initially used to contact us."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! I replied back to their email that they sent to MY EMAIL, and yet they're replying with that automated reply. If the email I replied back with isn't in your system, why am I not allowed to open a new account?? 
The most frustrating part about all of this is that they don't even provide a direct number to call Customer Service; they use this email/authentication process to not help customers as much as possible. All I know is that I will never use Uber again; not for myself, and not when I'm out with friends. I will happily be using Lyft from now as they've provided me with far better customer service than Uber has.

I had been using UBER since 2014, and had been happy with the services until the beginning of 2018. In the beginning of 2018, I would try to request a ride through the UBER app, but for some reason, the request would get denied and there was no explanation at all on the app. After months of trying this, I reached out to UBER a few times through my account and through their Facebook page. When they responded via their Facebook page, they stated that they will send an email to me to my email address. When they sent their email to me, it stated that my UBER account was suspended, but did not state the reason behind it nor did they state the time frame of the suspension. I was never made aware of the suspension until this email was sent to me. 
I replied to the email asking why my account was suspended and what caused for my account to be suspended considering that I had not used my UBER app for several months. No one replied to my email. I reached out to them several times regarding the status of my account and no response was what I received. UBER is a horrible rideshare who has no compassion and provides horrible customer service to all of their customers. They also do not have effective ways of communication and they are horrible at communication. If you want to utilize a rideshare, DO NOT EVER USE UBER!!

After my husband and I spent 50$ on a trip in July and got a receipt for said trip I pretty much forgot about it until a few days ago (October 27th) when PayPal notified us about 50$ coming out of our account from Uber - we panicked, thought there was some kind of theft going on and an hour later got an email from Uber explaining that, somehow even though we have a receipt we didn’t pay them and 4 months later, without warning they were taking 50$ from us. I remember this money leaving my account because it was a high cost ride, but seriously at best I’m misremembering and only thinking of the official receipt I got from Uber in which case they should write off their mistake or at worst they are double charging me.
I am actually a pretty loyal customer BUT in my case they are losing a customer, it’s not just the 50$ which is coming out of my account at an inconvenient time, it’s the entire way they handled it... offering a small discount on the next few rides. RIDICULOUS. I’ve had carried experiences with drivers and I’ve used Uber in several states, one or two negative experiences with drivers wouldn’t deter me, but this is a reflection of the entire company and I am disgusted.

I usually take the bus or train to the airport but Thursday morning Uber Express Pool cost only $5 more than my usual bus or train so I decided to go for that. First thing is that Express Pool seems to make you wait 5 minutes before connecting you with a driver. When it did connect me after 5 minutes it told me to walk a block to a nearby corner and the driver would be there in 4 minutes. 4 minutes became 9 minutes, then 11, then 16 and it became clear from the map that the driver was heading to the airport without me. 
I canceled but now the only way I was going to get to the airport in time was by full-priced UberX (costing me $15 additional). That driver told me there was a problem with the Uber software that morning. I reported this to Uber and they acknowledged a problem and said they would investigate. But no credit. All I asked for was a $10 credit towards a future ride. I use Uber for hundreds of dollars a year and my boss uses Uber for tens of thousands of dollars a year. I’m switching both of us to Lyft. And American Express has credited my account for the $15.01 “overcharge”.

I contacted Uber and they said sorry and to send pictures. I did and they said, ""Sorry Uber is UNABLE to provide compensation for damages of this nature..."" Huh??? Why ask for pictures and act like resolutions were being considered? Oh yeah they said they were going to review the driver's future with the company. LOL, right. I bet he’s still driving with no problem and I have to get new luggage. Uber doesn’t even have complaint category to allow you to report other issues than the specific information they want.

I urge you, do not use Uber. They are well known but as you use them please be sure to look closely at what they are charging and when they are charging. I strongly emphasize on the when. They charged me on a ride I never used even after I said they are not authorized to. I have record of the trip history as canceled just 2 seconds of calling for a ride and they blatantly ignored it. Never addressed that this was an unauthorized charged. 90 days after this trip, I was sent an email 3 days ago from them stating they will charge me because their system made a mistake. Shortly after this, I figured out that their loophole is to close the account 30 days after your trip so you cannot dispute it then send a notification 90 days later saying their system made a mistake to a ride that will be charged 14 days later. 
When I tried to reach out they said they can't do anything since the account is closed but send me an email that they are going to take money from my account. Taking out a payment for a service that was never used is what we call theft. They have zero customer service and it's very difficult to get a straight answer as they kept sending me the run around and not actually speaking to a representative but getting automated like messages not related to my concern. I sent about 6-8 emails asking for clarity but they kept sending automated emails saying they cannot change their policy like 4x in a row which was incredibly insulting. 
How is this legal? It makes me think how many others are they doing this to and taking money on the low from hard working people, claiming that their policy is untouchable and cannot be looked into based on the account is closed after 30 days. They are not customer oriented all, they are very dishonest and nasty. Please check your statements and not allow them to steal no matter how small the amount is.

I was a first time user yesterday, using a Samsung 7 Android and the Uber app, which was set up a week ago, in order to establish an account. It was around 6 pm and needed a ride to the hospital, was attempting to schedule a 6:30 am pickup the following morning. The app appeared to provide a 'Clock' to schedule, which I used, but prior to confirming there was no indication that the time would be 6:30 am. Thinking it was a screen update issue, proceeded and the time reflected 12:50. There is no way to edit, so I cancelled immediately and tried again, paying careful attention and again I ended up with 12:50, so cancelled that and had my Daughter add me to the 'Family' option, which worked out from her end.
Today I get charged twice, $5 each for the 12:50 time, I did use the app to refund, doubt much will happen however because there is nothing end user/customer friendly regards Uber. This is the close to have ever felt like being part of a herd of cattle, use it & no responsibility is taken by Uber. Customers be aware this company is a one way street, you as a customer have no reasonable means to deal with a legitimate app issue. It was not the driver's fault, though I would be curious who gets the $10 for no service and it was not my fault the app failed to process the schedule request.

I'm going to share a story about why I will never use Uber again. A month ago, my Uber account was hacked. In fact, AMEX confirmed to me that they had SEVERAL people calling in to say their Uber accounts had been hacked that week. Nothing on the media - strange? Within a 4 day window, 118 rides were charged to my credit card in USD - each totaling over $120+ CAD... Resulting in $8,200 of wrongful charges to my AMEX (thankfully I have fraud protection on my CC, so it was on Uber's end to stop the charges). Even though I alerted Uber immediately when it happened, it took them 4 DAYS to STOP the charges from being incurred/charged to my card.
Then - when it came to reimbursements... they were a disaster. It took them 2 weeks - and countless times of me following up every day (each time being passed around - WITHIN the SAME chat - from person to person, who had to keep ""looking"" into it), countless times of me spending wayyy too much of MY time providing them with every detail - over and over - for 118 transactions (because apparently, they aren't able to review past chat or ticket history?) - before they FINALLY issued refunds.
EXCEPT - they only issued refunds for the $5-$7 base fare amounts, not the $99 USD tips the hacker had added to each ride. This means they still owed me upwards of $7000+ CAD. More CONSTANT follow ups from my end - and they only respond when I follow up numerous times and threaten further action. Last week - they finally issue me a refund for the remaining THOUSANDS they owe me... But the problem is - because of the exchange rate differences (and the amount of time they took to do it) - now the amount I receive back to my account in CAD funds is about $100 less than was charged to me. Meaning they still owe me $100.
I'm exhausted at this point and just want what should be rightfully returned to me. I tell them they can even make it in the form of ride credits - it's simply not right for me to incur this charge. Back to customer service, another series of runarounds - finally to be told that they can't do anything about it. Really, Uber? I used to take Uber several times a week, as well as order from Uber Eats all the time. This is the WORST handling of customer service I have EVER experienced. I was already on the fence about using them, with all of the ethics issues they have - but now? I'm DONE. My partner, son and closest friends are done. Lyft - you've just won a bunch of new clients. I hope those that read this will feel inspired to move on from their ** ""service"" and choose a better one (better yet - walk/ride a bike/etc!). Now, time for a glass of wine.

A short while ago my social media was hacked, and it expanded into many of my accounts (Uber being one of them). I then went on to delete my account but Uber has a policy of leaving the account open for 30 days after for possible reactivation. This led to the hacker reopening my account and using my credit card. I have since had to change all my cards. After trying to find a number to call (which they do not offer for riders) I emailed them to try and get my account deleted immediately. After 3-4 emails back and forth with them all they have done is ""refund my money"" (which they said was completed, to a card that is no longer valid) and mark my account for deletion in 30 days (allowing that individual to open my account at their leisure).

Uber needs to understand that their cab pooling service is very time consuming for passengers. The drivers go even 1-2 kms off destination route to pick up and drop other pool riders. Kindly understand, this is very time consuming and we don't reach our destination early. Not like the fares are super-low that we have to bear this kind of torturous service. It would be awesome if Uber pool services are far more efficient, in the sense, each following pick up should not be of 5-8 mins of difference in terms of distance. In this way, more people will use pool services and add less to traffic jams. Uber should not just focus on making money but also contribute to lesser vehicles on roads which is very necessary in cities like Bangalore which is overflowing with traffic.

We ordered an UBER 12 hrs. ahead of time for a trip to the airport. We were ready, packed and just waiting for the scheduled pickup (which UBER texted). Ten minutes before our scheduled pickup we received a text stating that they were canceling due to our VISA card being expired. We DO NOT travel with expired credit cards. We did check our card and we had TWO years before expiration. Since UBER canceled, I started from scratched, ordered an UBER with the same card and it was processed (our driver was great, not his fault). We did make our flight but was very fast paced and very stressful. Maybe we need to order an UBER 24/48 hrs. ahead of time and if UBER needs to cancel for whatever reason, maybe they will give us the courtesy to text us with sufficient time."

Usually I travel to DFW airport daily for my job. Yesterday I rented Uber just as I do everyday. My driver was Glorelys. I am deliberately writing this review in order to educate consumers and since Uber has monopoly is U.S. and they feel nobody or no review can harm their reputation. This, Glorelys was new immigrant from Venezuela. I just don't want to discriminate, but because of my experience I asked her when did she moved to U.S.? She didn't know a single word of English. She was talking in Spanish with me and authorities at the airport. Though I was guiding her on right path, she didn't heed my advice since she didn't understand English. She roamed around airport for 1 hour and Uber charged me $12 more than usual charge. I was late for my job. Instead of giving me refund, it charged more for driver's fault. 
It's really horrible and loot. I don't know where should I report this incidence? With Fed or state govt? Or any other authority? I don't know how Uber recruit such people who don't know/understand English and are not familiar how to use GPS? Finally I started GPS on my mobile and handed over it to her. She fallen my mobile and broke the glass. Actually I owe refund for this too! This is really scam, fraud and loot. And nobody is accountable in this country!!! Are we the most advanced nation when citizen is looted like this? I wish to warn and alert all consumers about highly unprofessional attitude of Uber.

After many attempts explaining my situation, it became apparent that Uber has among the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Many contacts with Uber regarding this issue, here was my final attempt to receive fairness from this company. Actually my final attempt was today, Oct. 15, 2018 where I was advised that my claim is too old, their final excuse to keep my money. I began this process within a week of the trip. Here's my story...
On April 20th I arrived at Miami International Airport (MIA) after a trip. I opened my Uber app and confirmed the door at Arrivals where I should be picked up. The app did not ask me my destination nor did it indicate my destination to me. My driver arrived and I realized that he thought I wanted to go to Sarasota/Bradenton Int'l Airport, which I did not and told him I wanted to go home nearby.
The driver then gave me his other phone and asked me to enter the address into the navigational app, which I did. The driver then drove me to my home at the Four Ambassadors on Brickell Bay Drive in Miami. Subsequently, I received an email that erroneously stated my trip was over 2 hours long and 138 miles. I was billed over $174 for a trip that usually costs around $20. The app seems to have saved my previous destination that I entered a week earlier.
One week earlier I was visiting the Sarasota area and considered using Uber to go to the airport so I opened up the Uber app and entered my desired location but decided not to use the Uber service for that trip. The app quoted me a price of about $40 for that trip that I did not take. I exited the Uber app as usual. Now I'm aware that this overcharge is a result of entering a location previously but not using the Uber service. I was not quoted a price for my trip from MIA to my home and I was unaware of the problem with the app.
I wonder if my driver was aware of this situation and exploited my ignorance. Please help me resolve this issue. I am not a wealthy person and this overcharge is causing me to have problems paying my other bills. Thank you for your help. Today, I believe the driver was aware that I'd be overcharged and he'd have a good night at my expense. I also believe that Uber never intended to understand the situation nor refund my money should their driver be at fault. I've discontinued my relationship with Uber shortly after this trip when it became apparent that their business practices are not acceptable. Tell a friend...

I ordered an Uber and the driver was very nice so I tipped him atter. I kept getting error messages while trying to tip saying that it wasn't going through. I waited a few minutes, tried again, and success. The next day I checked my bank account and saw that I was charged the tip twice. I messaged customer service and they credited the money to my Uber account. I wanted a refund because I rarely use Uber and I just wanted my money because I only authorized a one time tip. After many back and forth messages they still refused to refund my money. I will never use Uber again."

I took Uber like I have many, many times before. I was taking my dog to the groomer and he was on my lap. He met left my lap and I carried him out the car. Needless to say he never made any mess. A day later I received notice from Uber that they had charged $150 dollar cleaning fee plus the regular fee. I emailed them and they sent me fraudulent pictures the driver had sent them saying the dog urinated on his rug. The picture was clearly the front seats of the car and I was in the back seat. Uber still said they believed their driver and would not refund me the money."

Booked 22 hours in advance no one showed up. Bad as that was, support and help department said: ""We're sorry to hear that your driver canceled your trip and that this delayed getting you to your destination. I can confirm that no cancellation fee was charged on this trip request. If you were referring to a different trip, please let us know."" Well that was nice of them. Then (obviously a form letter since I did not pay anything): ""We understand your concern. We know this is not the news you were hoping to hear, but we will not be able to refund this fare due to it not being within our standards. Thank you."" So, Uber has no policy if no one shows up after an advance booking? Won't be doing that again. Lyft next time."

First and foremost there is no phone number to contact Uber. Is that legal? Second of all, I have used Uber about 20 times. Great idea but what they do not disclose is that on top of the charge that you pay when you schedule a ride they add an additional charge usually under a dollar. For WHAT? Example: I just scheduled two rides, both for a friend about 30 minutes apart. The first ride was 14.67, the second ride was 15.37. I checked my account and they charged me .40 for no apparent reason and .12 for the second ride. They do not tell you what it is for but it is an unauthorized withdrawal. Pass this information on. How long will customers allow ourselves to be ripped off? It shows how absolutely lazy we have all become to even allow these companies to continue to rob us."

I have a disability which limits my walking. I can't drive due to severe nerve damage and uncontrollable reflexes. The closest store to me is a Family Dollar which is .02 miles from my house. The cost for me to Uber there is $6.50-$7.50. Along with all other companies promising cheaper pricing to make conveniences more affordable is yet another lie. After putting Taxi Cab Services out of business, rates skyrocketed. I can't say how so very disappointed I am with Uber. I have an upcoming surgery which I pray will be a success. I would love to be an advocate for anyone having to utilize transportation services due to no available bus routes so they may travel when needed at a fair price. I use to take Uber to work, the last two years I've paid a private driver to transport me to work, which is cheaper than Uber (12.4) miles 5 days a week. I haven't been able to work in the last 27 days and would appreciate the use of affordable transportation."

Well, I went to Lax from end of the el toro road which it was 54 miles and 1 hour and 8 minutes. When I called Uber to adjust the trip at the first he doesn't accept that and he said everything calculate right but when I prove that I am right he said, ""Yes you are right"" and instead of 50.17mile * 0.87per = 43.45$ 62.32 time * 0.1125= 7.01$. And also I had long pick up fee of 5.06$. So 43.45$+7.01$+5.06=(55.72$). But when they make a mistake to calculate the ride and also the support accept that on the recording line. 53.80$Miles * 0.87$ = 46.806 $ 68 minutes * 0.1125$ = 7.65 $. And also I had long pick up fee of 5.06 $. So 46.806$ *+ 7.65$ + 5.06$ =59.516 $.
Until now everything was ok. He accept everything and but suddenly he turned to me and said it’s the 55.72$ is right and I said, ""I just prove that to you. How can you say that"" and he said, ""Because it was an service fee of 18.58$ and it was an booking fee of 2.40$ and if I deduct them from that money"" and... I said, ""Hey buddy why you explaining all these to me?"" I don’t want to know and I don’t care how much Uber charging the customer, Uber can charge 100$ for just 3 mile, I can’t say why did you give me for example 3$ and took 97$ for yourself. 
They will turn around and tell me, ""Your fare with us calculate on the mile+time and 3$ for this ride is ok,"" basically they says very polite it’s not your business. So base on this I told the guy, ""Hey buddy I don’t care how much you gonna charge the customer"" and I don’t want to know and he get very aggressive to me and tried attack me so I get angry and mention that I did my part very well and my part was drive the passenger to the destination and I did but he said, ""Why did you said I don’t care"" and constantly repeating me on very aggressive and attacking way and shouting on me, ""Why did you said I don’t care?""
So because the argument was getting very bad I said, ""You know what what’s your name"" and he said John and I am absolutely sure his name is not John. I spoke to this guy maybe 100 times and he lie to me on the recorded line and it is shameful for the company like Uber and I said, ""You lie to me. Your name is not John"" and... at the end he refuse to give his name to me and I said, ""I want to speak with your supervisor"" and he get the 1000 different excuses to not pass the phone to his supervisor and he said they are very busy and I said, ""No problem. I will stay on the line"" and he start laugh to me and told me, ""Ok stay in the line"" and make joke on me and laugh on me and put me on the hold for ampler 51 minutes and every 10 minutes he come back and telling me, ""Hello are you there? Are you there?!"" And when I was answering, ""Yes I am"" he laugh again and put me on the hold again. 
After almost 51 minutes being on the hold he hang up the phone on me and I have all these recorded and he thought he is very smart but after all these years we know how we should act on situation like this. Now I am going to give them a call back and ask for the supervisor to speak with about this guy, he is most nastiest and rudest person in Uber support team, I spoke with him so many times and I always had problem with him. He done all these by perps to me and I believe he know me and he just wants to revenge me.
I haven't wants anything extra. I just wants my money that I worked for and I absolutely deserve that money. I won’t leave this man do whatever he want, I record everything live on the camera and I can put them in the YouTube to everybody. This guy break my heart, make me very upset, I feel like I have depression now, he accused me and I feel I am the guilty person and I want to die right now. I want to kill myself. If within next few hours Uber doesn't take any action against this guy I will put the all videos on the Youtube and speak with solicitor about this situation. 
I hope somebody take any action cos because of just one person all the Uber support team gonna get blame and because of just one person all the reputation of the company is gonna be in danger. You know what’s funny? The guy doesn't know I am capturing all the line and he was taking joke and laugh at me. That’s painful, that’s very nasty. I can’t forget other.

I ordered an UBER by entering the facility name on Monday. There was no issue with arriving time and price, then I confirmed it. However when I arrived there, it was not the one I wanted to go to. I definitely entered the correct facility name and the name of building I arrived was not even same name as I entered. Also I had to add the correct address by myself and they charged me again. I’m sure that the address UBER programmed into their system was wrong and they took me to the wrong place (driver was nice).
When I complained my issue on online, they don’t quite understand what I’m saying. So I asked them to provide the phone number to talk representative, but they said they don’t provide phone service (I think this is the worst thing). So I still tried to send the message them simply couple of times and eventually they said they will not be able to refund due to it is not their standard. I’ve still not understood why I had to be charged for their error. Even if I can not be get refund, I believe I should be at least get a credit for ride. This is what I sent them. Since I sent this message, it has been for 34 hours so far. And even though I’m still trying to contact them, they haven’t replied me yet and taken action. I’ve never seen such a bad customer service in my life.

Uber has made transportation much easier, however, it is overrated and expensive. Uber only cares about $ and drivers but does not care about customers at all. First there is not a phone number to reach if you ever encounter any kinds of problems. Only 10% of drivers are actually nice and professional. Uber taking your money when the driver cancels the ride is just ridiculous. Uber should not cut $$ from your account even if you cancel the ride. If our ride cancellations affects the drivers, then Uber should be able to solve that issue for drivers. Customers should not be paying even for a single penny, if they don’t use the ride.
Uber drivers can’t wait for you even for 5 minutes, however, customers are required to wait minimum 5 minutes for every ride. Most rides are delayed as well. Next, Uber driver never treats us well and makes you pay extra if you have to go a little extra. If you slam a door or whatever the ** it is, they underrate you. Uber has no guarantee about your safety. The pool is usually in 2 opposite directions so I don’t know how we are supposed to even call it a pool. Uber should strongly think about their customer service as strong as Amazon and Target.

On Sunday I booked an Uber from Ghatkopar to Vasai at 9 pm. The Uber driver's name was Anand, white wagon R. He arrived on time. When he arrived he asked me where the drop was. I told him it was Vasai so he said he couldn’t travel that far because he stays in Panvel and needs to go home. I asked him why did he take the booking then he said he didn’t know the drop location. Then I was stern that I will not cancel the booking so he said that someone was unwell at his home so he had to go urgently (I know he was lying). 
He then cancelled the booking on his own so I started arguing with him. He asked me how much fare was it showing to Vasai. I told him it’s showing 1000rs so he said ok. ""Don’t book another Uber. I will drop you to Vasai in 1200rs."" I got so angry on him for this... Some time back he wanted to go home because someone was unwell in his house and suddenly he was ready to drop me and demanding me for 1200rs. Horrible man. Please don’t take his bookings guys. His name is Anand and he has a white Wagon R. I don’t very well remember the number of his car but it had ** digit in it.

Uber drivers made me feel unsafe. I had one Uber driver harass me and kept calling after the fact I cancelled the ride because he had me waiting over half an hour and then called said he drove to wrong place. Most drivers are rude and somehow there's always an issue with the app, then they don't have customer service or a number where someone can be reached if there is an issue. And when I emailed Uber about the driver making me feel unsafe since he kept calling me and harassing me, their only response was to block the driver or call law enforcement. They need to fix the app and thoroughly background check these people they hire!"

Worst thing with UBER is that they do not have any REAL TIME SUPPORT. If anything goes wrong you have to fight with the driver and then take out time later on to sit and write a complaint and in reply all you will get are saved templates!!! I had to book and cancel six cabs back to back because driver denied destination and also denied cancelling the trip. And then the funniest thing is after all this UBER blocked from booking any more cab. It's like you go to a shop where the sales guy refuses to sell and then the Owner comes and ask you to leave because you did not buy anything. Is this BUSINESSES or MADNESS?"

I had a problem with a driver cancelling and being stranded on the street corner with no ride. I asked support if there was any way to schedule rides so I didn't experience cancellations among other concerns. I got a form letter response saying that the $5.00 I was charged for not getting a ride had been refunded (I already knew that). The email for Uber customer service does not allow for two-way communication. I guess Uber can provide nothing and call it customer service anyway."

I used UBER yesterday for a ride to my home address. After 3 mins in the car, I realized the traffic was too much so I asked the driver to drop me off at the nearest train station instead, which was just 7 minutes away from the spot where he picked me up. My wife booked the UBER thru her phone so I assume the driver would change the drop off location on his phone. An hour later, I receive my Uber receipt for a staggering $60.46!!! I was shocked because according to the receipt, the driver stated that he dropped me off at home which is a lie. I cannot believe they would lie like that and charge me $60.46 for a 7 minute drive.

Uber is a total rip-off. They scam drivers every day. You always see premium possible for long pickups but never get them. This means it should be a surge because no drivers are in that area. I have copies of all the premium possible trips and never get premium but charge rider a big premium. My last one was a 2.7 mile trip that took 5 minutes. Had to drive 18 minutes to get there and almost 5.5 miles. The rider paid 14.26. I got 5.43 and that included a 1.70 long pickup! Anyone who says they aren’t screwing drivers is either an idiot or a troll for Uber! That is criminal. I have pics of every one. What rider would pay 14.26 for a 2.7 mile ride that took five minutes??? Had to be surge! I had to drive 18 minutes and 5.5 miles to get to rider.
They also switched to miles driven and time because they know most people will get to destination faster as if 55 mph on Highway you always go 60–65 mph. So they skim from there on millions of rides and also they program longer routes and many times riders tell you to go a different way that is faster and all those trips Uber takes more of the fare. They are a scam company and should be sued for fraudulent practices. I would love to have someone prove they get premium when long pickup! I have done 11 total and have pics of every one and it clearly shows fraudulent practices. Uber Getting paid for surge but not showing it. But obviously the price riders pay is surge! That is ripping off drivers. Disgusting.

I was quoted $6.25 for my ride and charged that. Hours after my drop off I received multiple notifications of a charge of $16.14 and $9.87 being charged to my card for my one ride. Yes 3 separate charges for one Uber express pool ride. I immediately filed a complaint which really only wasted my time and pissed me off even more. I was bounced from rep to rep and had to restate the same information over and over and OVER again. The last rep made it seem like she had resolved the issue until today when I saw a pending charge of $16.14 on my company card which is linked to my Uber account for business travel. 
The original ride wasn’t a business expense and was charged to my personal card. Now they are committing credit card fraud and stealing money from me and my company.

The second driver charges me 10.88 because Uber claims I cancelled on them. I request a refund and then credit my account instead of refund my credit card. I don't want a credit, I want my money back. There is no way to request a true refund instead of credit. Uber charges what they want and decide how they will give you back money if they deem in necessary. I called Lyft after the 1 hours wasted and a driver was there in 2 minutes and the experience was fantastic. I hate Uber, they stole 10.88 and won't give it back.

I have never had an issue with Uber in the last two years of using their service until two days ago, when I scheduled a ride the night before. Upon entering the details, a window popped up on the app indicating a Pick Up guarantee. If the driver did not show up within the window of time allotted, the passenger would be credited $10 for a future ride so long as it met the eligibility criteria. My driver exceeded the window of time and arrived later. As a result, I was late to arrive for my appointment. I wrote to customer service and requested the credit. The rep stated they would credit $5 instead. When I quoted their policy verbatim, the second rep stated they would not be paying any additional credit. 24 hours later, they still haven’t even credited the $5.

No problems with the riders. Uber app charged the incorrect card at the end of the ride, despite profile setup. No big deal here. I requested the charge to be switched to the other in the account and they could not make this basic transaction in more than 10 days I left the ticket open. My periodic follow-ups were useful only to be told that a specialized team was looking into it. I never asked for troubleshooting details but only for the charge to be switched between the cards registered in the account. Customer service just bounced me back every time with no excuse, given the type of request. I could not add that ride to my expense report in time to be reimbursed by my company as it was a business trip. Thanks Uber for that!"

Worst case scenario with Uber is that they don't have customer care number available in India. I paid twice for a ride as I have booked a ride and paid via my debit card and transaction had done but Uber shows me an outstanding payment of my ride and when contacting them via email they response very slow. Plus when I finally got a call from them they said, ""We have blocked your card and to remove that send us the transaction script"" and even after sending them they said that it's not proper and after sending them one after another mail but still I don't get any reply. I am very much sure that Uber should be banned in India till they got a customer care office in India."

As Uber driver in North California. This is second time happen to me in within six months. I got a text message from Uber says they identified improper use of the app as a result they remove my promotion from my earning period and will deactivate my account if similar problem occur again. I talk to support customer service. They send my case to an expert and after waiting for 36 hour for their reply and demand them to explain to me what mistake I have done in order to avoid doing it again because I really care about my job as Uber driver. They seem to be careless and sent me same message. They send earlier like robot message.

I will not stop here. I am going to file a case in court regarding to this issue. I will sue you for two things. First for taking my earning money, second by not provided me with an accurate answer for what wrong I have done. You are such scammer and untruthful company full of bad attitude staff.

Uber has no customer service phone number. The only way you can communicate with them is by email. And it usually takes 4-5 days to get a response. My Uber account continues to be hacked even though I removed the app from my phone months ago. I am getting fraudulent charges on my credit card, but I cannot get Uber to help me. I just want them to delete my account completely so I don’t have to keep getting new credit cards."

I book cabs through Uber app a lot many times. Some experiences was good some was bad but my recent experience with Uber was just nuisance. I have to take my sister to the hospital as she was not feeling well in the evening, so I booked a cab via uber. The distance was hardly 3-5 km from my pick up location to my destination. First it took 10-15 mins to connect me with one driver when my pick up point is very near to the main highway (less than even 1 km). And 10 around cabs are always available in this area. 
Time was also not 8pm or after. Second, even when the app connected me to this driver named Mr. ** whose no. is **. I called him to know his exact location so that I came to know at what time he will arrive here but he was so rude like I am not a customer but a poor chap who is asking him for a lift. I was just saying something and he disconnected. I didn't react because I know this area is little crowded one and people get pissed sometimes due to traffic. His arrival time was 7 mins when I booked the cab but even after 10-12 minutes.
He haven't reached here nor I received any call from his side about his delay or cancellation or anything like that, then I again called him and surprise surprise he disconnected...like really wow...amazing...then suddenly the app shows another driver's information whose name is Mr. ** and no. is ** that he will come to pick us up so I called him because I have to go to the hospital. But when he picked up he told that he can't come as he just pass that area and don't want to come in that traffic area now. And it was devastated. I asked him then why he has accepted that request of mine when I booked the cab, he told he was not aware about the destination location because it was not shown at his end. I disconnected that call and tried to book another cab even after such incidents because that time going to the hospital was my priority.
But third time it took me 30 mins but even then that app was unable to connect me to any cab nearby. So I just ask someone to take us to the hospital. But really that was worst experience which one could face. Lots of complaints after this incident. In first place how this is possible that when we a book cab the other person is not able to see our destination address which the app asks us this in the very beginning of booking a cab and if there is some restriction that they only pass half the information about any customer's request then how the hell this business can work. 
Here we the customers are suffering and will suffer because if there is some emergency when booking cab is really important and reaching to the destination is the matter of life and death like in my case then what will we do. And second thing let's keep aside all the things, but when I told both of them that I have to go to the hospital then where their humanity gone, can't they be serious on this fact and that time they has to find some way out to fulfill their duty. But they only showed unprofessional behavior and inhumanity. Pathetic experience. Hope this will not happen again with anyone.

Customer service on the part of Uber completely sucks. Had problems requesting a ride twice that system errored, got locked out of my account because of your errors. Went through help to unlock it and it errored twice. Again same EXACT problem. Tried help again. ZERO response from customer service the second time even after following your prompts online. Bad for business when people are trying to use the service first time on vacation. Ended up having to use taxi service. It's over 12 hours later and STILL no response from Uber.

In June, I ordered an Uber car to pick someone up at Marseilles Train Station and bring them to an address that was one hour away. The screenshot of their quote showed that the cost would be between 192 and 254 Euros. There was absolutely no mention of a surcharge. They then charged me 471.02 Euros ($742.47 CA) saying the ride was at a high traffic time. It was 10:30 pm at an almost deserted train station. 
When I questioned the ridiculously high charge, they claimed that they had advised me of the higher charge and that I had accepted it. I asked 5 TIMES for proof of this and they completely ignored each email I sent with that question. After extensive email communication (you can`t call them), a lot of frustration and no satisfaction, I had to give up. Hell will freeze over before I use Uber again.

Humble, Texas. September 15, 2018, I ordered a ride and was picked up by Edwin, driving a Toyota Corolla. The ride was quoted as $11.45. Later that evening, I tried to order another ride and received a message that I owed $35.00 for the previous trip. I requested a review of the fare, because the morning ride is a regular ride to Dialysis, 3 days a week and $11.45 is in the normal range. I received a message today stating that the driver reported a mess made and I was provided with 2 pictures...there is no mess shown and I know a mess was not made because I didn't have anything to make a mess with.
I wrote back to them requesting a copy of the full report to include the time. I just received a message stating that they take these matters seriously and they reviewed my account and the driver's account and cannot refund the cleaning fee. But, they did not provide me with a copy of the report. So, drivers can tack on a cleaning fee to any rider they choose??? I also have a $31.77 gift card credit that I can't use until this fee is paid. I let them know that this is unacceptable and I will fight this as long as far as I can.

My issue with Uber is they quote you a price when you complete your trip and days later the price is different. They don't tell you anything. I started using one card just for them that is how I found out and if you check your receipt it's says wait time or toll surcharge and fees. This is robbery and they need to stop.

Since February of 2016, I've been using Uber on behalf of the company I work for to schedule rides for our clients coming into town. I've probably spent close to $1500 in gift cards alone since then. I've never had a problem until yesterday. After two company cards, a PayPal account, and multiple attempts to pay through the app and the Mac, I could not get their system to accept a payment. I confirmed with my bank, that the issue is not the card. In fact, the bank is holding these transactions. But Uber doesn't have a record of them.
I've called, I've E-mailed, I've Facebooked. The number that is everywhere, and the number everyone keeps referring me back to is 884-324-2346 for customer service. When I spoke to a rep regarding the issue, she told me she couldn't help me. She couldn't find the transactions listed on her end, and that they are only a vendor and can't take payment for the gift cards over the phone. She asked me if there was anything else she could help me with. My response was something like, unless you can refer me to someone who can help me purchase these gift cards, or an alternate way to obtain them, I guess you've done what you can. She could not, and the conversation ended.
After this, I reached out over Facebook, since I didn't receive any responses to the original E-mail. They told me they couldn't locate my request. I sent the Reference ID sent in the E-mail I originally sent out. In turn, they sent me another E-mail with the same phone number. I called 11:54 am, EDT. There was no response, so I left a message.
It's not about the amount spent, as I'm sure it's meager compared to other companies or individuals, but it's about the principle of the matter. Overall, I really like Uber, but it seems impossible to get assistance should something happen. It's very disappointing and frustrating. I don't really want to switch to one of their competitors, but for something like this, I need a reliable company and this experience was frustrating enough that it may force me to consider alternate options for our future seminars. I really hope to reverse this review in the future, but I'll definitely be thinking twice about supporting this company.

I had booked a ride to take us from a restaurant on Canal Street, to the West Village. The driver stopped at the wrong place. We signaled him NOT to make a U turn on a busy street: we'd cross with the light. We did. He charged us for waiting time. Then he took the wrong route, and we wound up in New Jersey. We told him he had the wrong route, and he screamed ""I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING."" In Jersey City, there was an accident in front of us - a bad one. He swerved, and nearly started a second one. Then he told us ""as a courtesy"" he wouldn't charge the NJ surcharge. After we got back to NY (another ""courtesy"", he wouldn't charge us the toll), he started taking us to Brooklyn. Twice. Again 'I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING'. Two sixty year olds have to act like James Bond and jump out of the car when it stops, to get away. We were further downtown than when we started. Uber's reaction?

I’ve driven for Uber for 3 years and constant battle for them to get fares accurate or my rides disappear completely. And it’s always in their favor. And always the bigger fares. I’ve never been overpaid for a ride accidentally. Customer service is a joke. They act like idiots who can’t understand common English and only ever send a canned response. It is the most frustrating customer services I’ve ever dealt with. Uber treats drivers as though they are expendable. When they list how many miles I drove on a ride it is always less than that what I actually drove according to my GPS.
On average they take 44%-55% of the price the passenger pays by adding on extra fees. Sometimes more. Drivers are left to carry the heavy expense and most of the time passengers pay so much for the ride they don’t want to tip. The thing that worries me the most though is that passengers personal information comes through on my end sometimes or mixes their information up with other passengers.
I have called a passenger I’m picking up before for directions many times and get a completely different person with an Uber account who did not order a ride. And the last time this happened the call went to an Uber driver in a whole other state who was out driving. Go figure? I would not recommend this company to anyone as a driver or passenger. They are the worst. If you want good service use Lyft. I’ve been driving for them also and in 3 years have not had any issues at all as a driver. Not 1. They are an awesome company. Treat drivers like they appreciate us. They pay better and charge passengers far less.

Uber is continually squeezing profit away from drivers by changing their policies. I've been driving for over a year and have a nearly perfect rating. I do a fantastic job for this company and I feel completely unappreciated. I am not alone. Every month that goes by, Uber finds ways to change their policies to be less friendly to drivers, who they call partners. They have made it clear to me more than once that I am expendable. Regardless of the service that I provide for them, they are aware that hundreds of other drivers signed up today, and if I don't like it I can leave. They're changing incentives that we have counted on and taking up to two-thirds profit in many rides.

Driver took me to wrong destination - claiming I had entered the wrong address. I typed the address into the app, but it defaulted to another address (thanks, Uber). I paid about $12 extra and 15-20 extra minutes to get to the right place. I hate Uber. They just don't get it. LESSON LEARNED: When getting into the car, BE SURE TO CONFIRM your desired destination by exact street address with the driver. Uber's drivers simply follow the GPS in the app and won't ask to confirm. Uber's drivers are stupid automatons. No wonder Uber is on forefront of developing driverless technology... they are practically there already. The Uber app will offer several alternate destinations as you type in the destination address. If you, by chance, tap the wrong one - and don't notice - you'll wind up on wrong side of town. Uber accepts no responsibility. Be careful using its app. Be careful with Uber. They rip you off and you have no recourse."

As a former UberEats driver this company has HORRIBLE customer service and most of the representatives cannot comprehend English. They take you around and around asking you the same questions over and over again and they have no respect for the drivers, though they love issuing apologies without solving your issues. They have constant issues with their app and as an UberEats driver your trips REGULARLY go missing and you have to fight tooth and nail for your missing money, IF they even solve it. It sucks when your trips go missing because you then lack proof of the delivery unless you screenshot your trip (which is ridiculous to have to remember to do for every trip) which makes speaking with their unprofessional representatives even more difficult. 
The customers and restaurants are all friendly and awesome but the Uber representatives and company sucks as well as their pay. With all the mileage and wear and tear to your vehicle you'd think they'd pay more or take much less of a percentage of your money. Rip off to drivers and I WOULD NOT recommend this to anyone looking for work. They don't pay enough for a decent living by any means and they currently don't have a line for you to speak with a live UberEats representative unless you are live on a delivery.

Uber is fine unless you're trying to cancel a trip. I accidentally booked a trip. I contacted the driver and immediately within 30 seconds and he did not cancel it. I responded again 5 minutes later. The driver did not cancel. He finally told me to cancel after he arrived at my destination. The issue I have is that there's no cancellation button. I was scrolling through every area of the Uber app trying to figure out how to cancel this ride even after I contacted the driver and I could not locate anything. Upon intensive internet search trying to find an 800 number to call Uber directly and being unsuccessful I finally did an online search and was told thru a wiki article how to cancel a trip... to click on a tiny picture of the driver to access the cancel button. This is deceptive practice. I was charged $13.37 because of the driver's time because he did not cancel the ride and I had no idea or information on how to cancel it myself. 
From personal Lyft does not have this issue. They have a cancel button that is very easy to see and find even for first timers. If they're going to be charging a rider and do not have access or information posted in The Help section of an Uber app to cancel a ride to me it is unfair to even be charging a customer and I believe at some point over will be faced with litigation regarding that if they continue to operate their system without a phone number and without a help option to be able to cancel a ride. The only way you can cancel a ride is to tap the driver's photo which is very tiny at the bottom of the page. When you tap the photo of the driver as you scroll down you can find how to cancel. There's no indication otherwise and no one would know that they needed to tap a photo that is half the size of my pinkie finger... deceptive at best!

I've decided to write a review only after a second experience of this kind. I will continue to keep close tabs on all Uber charges from now on. The fìrst time I was charged for a round trip to and from airport at the next pay level up (limo level). Uber was adamant about the charge along with the driver, despite the verifiable fact that had I actually made the trip reported, I wouldn't have landed in another city which happened to be 2 hours away by plane. This was 3 hours after I arrived at airport. The other issue verifiable by Uber's hold on my credit card for the correct amount. Price was double the authorized charge.
Second incident was also for a charge at the next pay level. The insult to injury being that the driver here reported taking a route that was definitely not used. Through a toll tunnel instead of the toll free bridge, he in fact used. I believe this was done because I spent the trip talking to my foreign speaking dad in another language. He must have assumed I was easy prey.
Both matters were not settled honorably or honestly by Uber. I had my credit card company handle the dispute. Then. On the second incident Uber put a hold on my account, refusing me a ride until I paid for the disputed ride in full. They said that I was negligent when it was them who was negligent in failing to respond to the complaint for over 1 week. I was at airport with no cash and a phone about to go dead. So I paid. They continued in their failure.to respond. Again I called credit card company to intervene.
No letter of apology from Uber. No apology from driver. I was not allowed to post driver review. No call from Uber customer service asking if I were satisfied with resolution of problem. All basic common business practices. I am wondering how long it will be before Uber is held accountable by regulatory authorities. It is unconscionable that such a large company is free to operate without any accountability.

So I scheduled at 4:15 to 4:25am pick-up from Uber to go to airport. Uber driver notified at 3:50am and dispatched to my house. Driver leaves before my pick-up window, does not tell me he is waiting (neither does App) and I get charged a cancellation fee. I try a second time to locate a driver on Uber but none available and a driver also not available on Lyft. I end up with a taxi and a hefty fare charge. Uber touts that they offer a guarantee that your driver will be there during your pick-up time or they will give you a $10 credit. It took two e-mails to get Uber to reverse the cancellation fee, this happened only after they admitted that their driver left early. Poor, poor driver service and customer service. If Uber will not stand behind their guarantee then how can you trust them to pick you up on your scheduled time? I only ask for accountability and dependable service, isn't this what we are paying for..."

The booking fee is a phony ploy to enhance the total bill. It is a tactic used by unscrupulous cell phone providers and wifi providers. My experiences with Uber have been very positive but I really resent the cheap shot of adding a ""booking fee."" It is completely unnecessary, and uncalled for."

I have used Uber twice and received good service. The drivers were prompt and polite and UBER billed me correctly and efficiently. However, today I had a bad experience. I contacted Uber. I was told the driver was 3 minutes away at a nearby market, which is about 3 minutes from my home. I waited 10 minutes and the driver was still 3 minutes away at the same market. I waited 15 minutes, then I texted the driver to tell them that since they didn't show, I wanted a credit. I had to get a ride from someone else since I was already late for my appointment.
I cancelled the ride since the driver never showed up. A few minutes later I did notice that the driver was on my street, but I had already reached my destination without them. I received an email from Uber that the trip was cancelled and I would be billed $5.00 for cancelling. I complained to them that I didn't cancel by choice. The driver led me to believe that they were only 3 minutes away, but didn't show for over 20 minutes. I had no idea if they were going to show or not. The driver never advised me that they were running late. Uber replied that they would take $5.00 off my next ride, so in short, they were not going to actually credit me. They were obligating me to use them again to receive a credit. This was not handled well. I have signed up with Lyft, hoping I will receive better service.

The driver has submitted a claim for $150 through the app. After calling him through the Lost Item option on the app and confronting him about it, he claims he has no idea what I'm talking about and that he's ""too busy"" for this. His claims are false and fraudulent, and I will NOT be held liable for a fraudulent scam. I will be reporting this company and your driver to the police for fraud. I will also report you to the Better Business Bureau and raise hell on any and every social media site known to mankind. 
Every Greenlight location in the state of Florida will have a detailed review on how your team allows drivers to scam riders. I have found the driver on Facebook and am now armed to go to the police with his full name and license plate. If your team pushes this fraudulent charge through on my card, be prepared to face legal action. Please note that I have not one, but TWO other witnesses who were with me in the car that can attest to there being no mess left behind in that man's vehicle. They are both prepared to give sworn statements against your company and your driver.

Whenever I book a bike or cab from Uber they never came in location from which I have booked the cab. They always go somewhere else, the problem with uber is picking up the location. Its app picks up the wrong location and the drivers goes somewhere else, then I need to help drivers to get my location. So here is the incident: yesterday (10 Aug 2018) I booked a Uber bike and I put my drop location, the same location I always puts whether it’s uber or Ola and before reaching the exact location the driver says, ""This is the location you have put and I will not go beyond this location,"" I told him that, ""You will need to go from another side. This street is closed to get my place,"" he denied to go. I told him, ""If you drop me on my location then you will be paid otherwise no payment."" 
Also I told him that in Morning I was trying to book a bike or Auto from uber they have charged me fine as last time that bloody driver didn’t cancel the ride as he said that I will not be able to come for that I had to pay some fine. What rubbish is that huh??? I will put this on consumer court as well. The uber drivers are not well versed in how to behave with customers. They argue with customers and cheats on customers.
I never faced this kind of a issue with Ola, never. They never cheats on customers, they never denies to come on location, they never charges extra, they never come late, they are very polite with customers but Uber drivers, they are having ego issues, they are impatient, they are not polite to customers, they cheats on customers, they straight away says no, they charge whatever they want. So uber, you better tell your drivers to behave and have some courtesy about customers. I will put this on everywhere cause this is not the first time, every single time I have this issue with uber. I will never use uber ever in my life again and I will tell this to all my known and also I will tell this to everyone on roadside as well. Yes definitely!!! If it is in my hand I will put this on media as well!!??

I’m really disappointed with Uber for what I feel was “pointing of a gun at my face and rip me off” at the very last minute when I needed the service the most. I had book a trip from Madrid to the Airport, I was showed a fare from low to high, I was ok with it, I ordered the service. Less than 10 minutes before my trip, I received a message from Uber saying that due to congestion and demand (6AM and Madrid was empty), I will be charge 50% or more. I received this message and at the same time the confirmation that the driver was on its way. 
Worst thing, when I felt I was being rip off, is the message from Uber saying that I have “10 minutes” to cancel the order If I did not want it (if you don’t is like you agree and you get charge. I saw this message on my phone when I had only 3 minutes left). That’s pointing a gun in your face, when you need to go to the airport, when you don’t have time to use other service or a cab, that you MUST pay then 50%. I’m sure your evil system knows that at that time in the morning, with someone going to an airport to catch a flight, and 10 minutes before needing to leave, the client is just ready for a ransom. Your evil system knows it.
I don’t imagine saying to my clients 10 minutes before delivering my services “is 50% more on the agreement, and you have 10 minutes to cancel or I will charge you”. As a client I felt bad because 10 minutes before providing a needed service, saying to a client to pay 50% more or cancel the service, is a rip off and you definitively get a bad taste in your mouth for being rob. I will never again use the service and I will tell everybody about my true story.

Beware. This company allows drivers to submit fake pictures claiming you made a mess of their cars and will charge you up to $150 extra without even giving you the common decency of a phone call. I was hit with a totally false charge and Uber initially refused to refund me. I did absolutely nothing to the driver or his vehicle yet when this claim hit my email, because Uber does absolutely nothing over the phone, they had already charged me without hearing my side for any details. Please avoid this alleged criminally designed company. They are not worth the headache and definitely not worth your hard earned money."

The Uber website states they have a phone numbers for customer service, (not the emergency number, or one out of Singapore), to reach someone 24-7. That is an untrue statement.

I have never experienced a worse service experience than I have had with UBER both here in the US and on my recent trip to the UK. I don't understand how a company can be allowed to do business when it treats their customers the way I was treated. I got a promotional code from Citibank AAdvantage credit card services to use a promo code so I can get credit on my first 2 rides with Uber. I had never used Uber before so I downloaded the App and proceeded to put in the promo code. I kept on getting error messages so I tried to get a customer service phone number in the US. To my surprise a company as big as Uber does not offer any phone customer service in the US. A multibillion dollar company with NO PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
I tried using the Help line in the App and finally got a rep reply back to my concerns. Worst experience ever, I TYPE IN WHAT MY ISSUE IS BUT THE HELPDESK ANSWERS WITH SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUE I AM HAVING. We exchanged further messages but the person had no clue how to answer simple questions. Finally I got a person to understand the issue I was having and due to all the issues I had already had, I was promised a $20.00 credit on my next ride that would apply automatically once I used Uber.
Once again an absolute untruth I took my ride and since the credit did not apply I tried to message the helpdesk again but as usual, the person had no clue what I was speaking about. NO PHONE HELP AND NO ONE TO HELP US WHEN YOU ARE CHARGED WRONG ON YOUR CREDIT CARD!!! All be aware, do not use Uber as you will be robbed of your money and there is no one to help you remedy the problem. The most horrible customer service experience I have ever had dealing with a major corporation doing business in the US.

I had left my phone in an Uber car whilst away on business in San Jose in April, I am yet to have a satisfactory conclusion to my dispute. I went to my hotel room and got my tablet device and went to the Uber website and logged in however, couldn't do anything without an SMS verification which would be sent to my phone which was in the car, so pointless. I downloaded the Uber app on device but couldn't operate anything there. I even logged onto Samsung website and attempted to force my phone to ring but it was out of power. The only way I could get hold of Uber was by writing on Twitter at how bad my experience was and they asked me to private message. I then explained where I went from and to and the times and took a snapshot of the email receipt for the trip. 
The next day, I continued to private message them to get them to get hold of the driver and confirm how to get my phone back and emphasized that I was leaving San Jose to get a flight back to New Zealand at 3:30pm. After sending 5 messages up until 3:10pm, I finally get a response saying that my phone was not in the vehicle. I fly back to NZ and four days later I get a message saying, ""we have your phone, how would you like to get it back?"" - this is after I had did a police report, paid for new phone, wiped my old phone, setup new phone - deleted all the media on the old phone which was all the footage from a very important tech conference and the whole purpose of my visit to San Jose.
I asked them for compensation of vouchers on my account so I could get money back over time. I also suggested that they should create a link at the bottom of the email they send so that if I have lost anything like my phone, add contact details which could be sent directly to the driver for that trip. Nothing. I am utterly disgusted that although I lost my phone, they have no mechanism to sort the problem out and avoid all responsibility even though it is obviously a broken process their end. A normal taxi journey would require a call to the company whose number is on the receipt and get it sorted in 15 minutes. There lies the problem.

I was very happy with Uber until my last experience when I had a ride with Uber to Kashmiri gate. When I booked the ride I was shown 188/- for my ride. As soon as driver arrived he said it is 285/- fare showing on his app. I thought it will be updated. At the end of the ride driver asked me to pay the amount showing on his app. I showed him it is 188 on my end. He said, “You can escalate it later with Uber. Right now you will have to pay 285/”. I paid it, also the receipt I got from Uber is still showing 188. 
Later on I contacted Uber regarding the same but to my surprise they simply denied to help me saying since the transaction was made out of Uber system they can't do anything. I didn't understand the word ""OUT OF UBER SYSTEM"". Just because I paid in cash it was not their responsibility to resolve the issue. I asked them to at least give me the correct receipt but they stopped replying to my emails. And the issue remains the same. I’m so dissatisfied with the kind of response they gave and simply denied to take the responsibility just because I paid in cash. I guess it is their practice to earn more money out of customer.

I’ve use Uber for the last 2 years and never complained about anything even when I had small issues. Today I’ve tried to talk to a human being for the last 4 hours and there is NONE existence!! The automated stupid robot keeps emailing be nonsense - I asked for A ride at 4:30 am and it said driver is 9 min away for $35 rate - after 30 minutes I saw on the app that the driver is struggling to find the place - I called, texted and no response. Finally he canceled. Second driver showed 7 min away with the same rate. The same exact thing except this one the driver at least called. Trust me I don’t live in a desert. I’ve had many rides on the same location. 
After 90 min of wait outside of my brother's house (because I didn’t want to wake the entire family at 5 am) the third driver with a higher rate showed up. It is only fair to adjust my rate to the original rate plus some sort of compensation for the inconvenience it has caused me instead of the stupid app sending me nonsense responses. On top of all the charges me for not being ready I was outside for 90 min. The driver did not wait a second for me. Shame on you Uber. This will be my last ride and I will write many more reviews on social media as I have picture of all this transaction as a proof so you cannot deny and make up stories.

I ordered an Uber around 1130pm on July 20, 2018 for a 4.6 mile drive that would normally take 10 minutes. The regular car said it would cost almost $17 and the rideshare option was between $11-12. I opted for the cheaper option to save some money. The app told me the driver would arrive in 5 minutes, I waited in excess of that for the driver, fine. I get in the vehicle and settle in to look at my phone to see the fare jumped to $14.06. I agreed to one fare and Uber charged me over the agreed upon fare. Not to mention the driver drove so slow as if he was waiting for another pickup along route. I arrived to my destination much later than expected. He would stop at stop signs and wait half a minute before moving, it was past midnight at this point and there was nobody on the road. He also drove a route that was slightly longer than another. 
I reached out to Uber who told me that there were no discrepancies in price, then they told me that it was in an acceptable range of the agreed upon price. I wasn't aware that you can agree on a price and then have it change without your knowledge. I do not like their practices and believe they are a scam. Customer support sounds like automated robotic answers, they do not solve issues. I will be deleting my account. I would rather walk the 4 miles than give my money to an undeserving corporation.

I tried to log in to my account using my computer but that was unsuccessful. I tried to change my password to log into my account. Unsuccessful - the new reset link was never sent.
I then tried to cancel my account. Again, not able to. I am now going to challenge the charges with my bank. There is NO WAY to contact a human at Uber - the methods on the internet didn't work. I have been charged for services without justification and there is no way to resolve this.

Uber has really been difficult. I would like to use my account to order food but the number associated with my account is almost 5 years old. I haven't had that number in AT LEAST 3 years but they will not allow me to change it because according to support the only way to change it is through the app. So I download the app and enter my number but obviously that doesn't work cause it's not associated with my email. It is however associated with the driver account I attempted to make but there was no email associated with that account because the process was not finished.
That being said, I took to the chat to see if there was any other way I could change the number but the young lady told me that I contacted the wrong support and gave me a link to submit a claim. So basically, ""I can't help you but our computers with get back to you with our best automated response."" After sending the link she left the chat. So I thought maybe I could change the number on my driver account but when attempted to open a new chat window the same window opened up. I asked if there was anyone to help me then received notification that someone had joined the chat then immediately left the chat. So now I have two separate accounts can't be used. I have always had issues with Uber. You can't have this type of system and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. That's literally insane. Good for jobs... bad for everything else.

It is a good service but the website or app has very little on questions from users. It is very difficult to see if the service is good or not through the website. You need to try it first and the service keeps on changing without notice. Which in some ways is great but no upfront info or call in to talk to."

I was planning on taking an Uber to Midway airport on my recent trip to Chicago. I was planning on leaving at noon. I checked what it would cost me around 11:30. I was quoted $35. 20 min later when I got down to the lobby and ordered my Uber, the price jumped to $58! I switched to Lyft which was only minimally cheaper. Next time I will leave myself more time and take the train! Very disappointed because I really enjoyed taking Uber from the airport. Never again! Taxis are cheaper!"

The Uber app has the help option but only accommodates a number of preset problem configurations and absolutely nothing outside of it. I had an issue where I was grossly overcharged for a ride. Now there was construction in the area but the driver admitted that he was completely unfamiliar with the area and therefore his lack of knowledge was the more significant reason for my delay.
However when I submitted my feedback on the trip I chose the option that there was construction and the app refused to refund me or give me any other option to dispute. It was then that I discovered that there is no way to contact Uber. Calling the 1-800 number results in a voice mail indicating that they don't accept phone calls and that you have to email them at support@uber.com. When you email support@uber.com you receive an auto-response telling you that you only option is to submit feedback in the app. This has cause me to really question Uber as a company and their commitment to their customers. Based on this experience I have decided that I will probably not use Uber anymore as a service and I will spread the word on these significant shortcoming.

Uber was a life saver when we needed it. The drivers were all wonderful courteous people but the company was not so great. There is no way to get help or even talk to someone from the company and the app was difficult to navigate. There were added fees like Uber technology fee that were not explained or mentioned that was just taken out of our account. There wasn’t even a way to ask about it and the drivers got none of the extra money!! Lastly, I kept getting strange texts for Uber codes after I began the process of trying to be a driver. I changed my mind when I found out someone was already trying to hack my account and rack up an unknown amount of charges on it. I will not use Uber again unless it is like the last time I had to do it an emergency with no other options."

The first (and last) time I ever used Uber, the fare estimate was $61. When I logged on to book a car, I got a screen that looked like upgrade options, the lowest of which was $89. There was an option to ""Skip this Step"" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total. Terrible company in my experience."

I requested a ride from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty. The rate was $26 and supposed to take 20 mins. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Uber at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare. Numerous emails back and forth got me nowhere so I am left having to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay away from this scam artist company."

They play around with the prices a lot, both Uber and Lyft. You're using a App and it’s not really a “company“. That’s customer based oriented and you can just pick up the phone and deal with someone. You're a number and it’s not personal. The drivers bare all the cost, they pay for the car, the maintenance, the gas, their time and they are not a employee with benefits. Uber maintains the app but they charge the customer too much and keep too much from the driver. It’s up to 40-50% in Uber fees and cost for doing nothing."

The driver ""cancelled"" and they charge me a cancellation free!! - I use the App for an Uber to pick me up from a gated community. The application directs me to a pickup intersection about 1/4 mile from my current location (on a very hot muggy night). I arrive there but me driver. After a 10 minute wait, I get a ""ride cancelled"" message from the App. At the time of the message notification, I see the driver on the App about a mile away at one of the entrances.
Long story short, I assume the development security wouldn't let the driver into the complex. So I walk to the entrance (my cellphone very low on its charge) only to find that it was a resident only entrance. The driver did not proceed to a manned security entrance. Now I try to get another driver, but my phone dies. I then had to walk 1/2 mile to a gas station, ask the attendant to allow me to charge my phone for 15 minutes (thankfully they did). I was then able to use the App to get a driver from Uber to take me home. I was very upset with the driver that cancelled my ride causing me substantial stress and almost two miles of walking. 
So imagine how upset I was to receive an email informing me of a $6 cancellation fee for the ride that was cancelled. To add insult to injury, Uber doesn't have any link or contact information on their site to address such grievances. You would expect them to have a means to resolve financial disputes on their website. That tells me they don't believe they have enough competition to provide that level of customer service.

Real examples from my Uber app: The rider paid $7.60, Uber got $3.93 (more than 50%) and I got $3.67. Another rider was charged $9.35, Uber got 4.74 (more than 50%) and I got 4.61. In 10.76 I got 5.90 and Uber got 4.86. Another rider paid 28.35. I got 17.45 and Uber got 10.90. From 11.91 I got 6.84 and Uber got 5.07. From 12.00 I got 7.54 and Uber got 4.46. 
I don't understand their formula as they don't take a fixed portion as you can see from these examples but they take 30-50%, and as I said we do mostly minimum rides of 3.67 in this town so Uber takes mostly 50%. Lyft is almost exactly the same in terms of payments. In towns like this, you can't rely on Uber/Lyft only as source of income, sometimes I get only 4-5 rides in a 5 hours, sometimes I do 8-10 rides in the same time, so it's uncertain and unreliable. Don't forget that you will have to pay taxes as well at the end of the year, income from Uber/Lyft is recorded and you have to file taxes yourself through w9 or 1099, means you are self-employed and self employed pays more taxes than other payroll jobs.
Uber/Lyft should pay better and take less than 40-50% to encourage drivers to work for them. There are many drawbacks in their systems, you don't know where the rider needs to go. Example: I accepted a ride on Lyft and drove 8 miles to pick him up and he was going only 2 blocks away so I got only the base fare. Lyft don't pay good in long pick up, Uber is better there. If you don't accept a ride Lyft sends you repeated messages, their message is strange, it says 'it's in the benefit of the community to accept rides, it leaves good impression of our service blah blah'. Why don't they think that it's not in the benefit of the driver, driver is not a free community service, and if you are concerned about the community then donate your 50% share to driver so he can serve the community better.
Another negative side is I am allergic to dogs, I use my vehicle for family as well. but you can't deny a ride with a pet as it's considered a serious violation. I will leave Uber/Lyft because sometimes I feel that I am wasting time. Yes you are on a risk, I hit a car last week while got a ride request on Lyft, my focus was on the app, my fault though, that will affect my insurance in future. Positive side is that you have freedom of work, no boss, no manager, some extra income on the side if it's your part time job. In major cities drivers are making good money on Uber/Lyft.

I was shown a basic fare for the Uber ride that I booked and the amount is usually same for that route (even with Lyft). The ride was completed and the basic fare was deducted which was fine. However, later Uber decided to an additional 5$ on the base fare giving the reason that the route had a flyover where Uber takes surcharge or toll. I often go by that route but never have I paid any toll or surcharges before. I asked them why wasn't it shown in my base fare or when I booked the ride, they did not have any proper answer. I had attached the response to this complaint. Kindly refer."

Uber really sucks. I took a Uber ride a month back and I wanted to get the receipts for the same. Since it was not sent to my email, I was trying to go online and to check it, however the authentication process of ""I'm not robot"" was so annoying. The process goes likes this, it asks you to select the pictures with the keyword that was given in the heading like 'Cars', 'Streets' from the list of pictures. I was doing it for some time, but Oh my god, it was so frustrating that it never ends, it will ask for some more than 50 times and it really tests your nerves. I wasted an hour on figuring this out and I finally gave up with super frustration. Guys... seriously... do you really value consumer feeling.

I recently needed the services of an Uber driver in order to make a doctor's appointment on time. I ordered the Uber the night before my appointment so as to avoid any problems that would potentially occur by doing so at the last minute. Little did this help as the driver could not find my address the next day and cancelled the pickup request causing me to run late. Some days later I found a $5 charge had been made to my credit card for the driver's cancellation. (I don't understand how Uber can get away with billing the customer for the driver's cancellation.) Consequently, I disputed the charge with my credit card company who immediately refunded my money.
Some days later, I attempted to use the Uber app to schedule another ride (from a completely different city & state) only to find I was unable to do so because of a $5 balance due!? I scrambled to find a customer service phone number only to discover there is none! Instead my phone app directed me to read through lots of verbiage to find a website which offered no help whatsoever. In the end, my efforts were a big waste of my precious time, energy and patience. My experience causes me to wonder how many other riders have been extorted by Uber. I have no intention of paying money I don't owe -- not even a mere $5.

Had my first ride with Uber. I was excited to get 15 dollars off my first ride. You see I have been taking Lyft back and forth most work days and since I am a well known rider my promos are somewhat limited. I spend enough for a car payment every 2 weeks and well I've never had a bad experience and even though most of my funds are used for this type of transportation, not once have I felt insecure or worried that I would be late or even have a thought of not making it at all. Today was a totally different experience. I ordered my ride on the Uber app and even though it's a little different I had no trouble figuring out how to add my 2 stops. I was charged and told my driver would arrive in 8 mins so my daughter, husband, and I waited at the front of my apartments at the office like we always do. 
Time kept passing and on my app I was to expect my driver George in 8 mins, so some time went by and my app was still showing 8 min wait and this made me a bit nervous. I call George through the app and he picks up. I kindly ask him how far away he was because my app must be lagging to update and well he could only tell me he doesn't speak english. The call is dropped and so I call again and he answered and once again not realizing that he really does not understand a word I am saying I continue by asking if he was on his way and how far was he. Once again he says, ""I speak no english,"" so I say, ""Ok."" I am really a little tense and well regretting the choice I made to take an Uber but it slowly eased when he pulls in and we get in. 
The 1st stop was to drop off my husband and the way there I started to be less anxious. We dropped off my husband and George comes to open the van door as to help me out as well and I stated, ""This isn't my stop. My daughter and I need to go to work."" He said as he pointed to his cellphone's gps and said, ""Uber no more..."" I said, ""Yes sir I paid for 2 rides and this is only the 1st ride."" He then again pointed to his cellphone and said, ""Uber no more..."" At this point my husband is attempting to reason with him and George had no idea what we were saying and now I am truly worried. My daughter and I are trying anything now as far as google translator hoping this will help the communication block. 
Finally he started to turn around due to it being an end road and stops the van to say once again, ""Uber no more,"" as he points to gps. My daughter finally says into the translator from google that all he needed to do is update his ride on his app. He speaks into the translator and his message was, ""I am at the end. No more directions for this ride or something in that area."" Minutes pass and I am at the point to where I'm pleading with him, ""Please sir we need to get to work."" 
I paid Uber for 2 rides. My daughter asks him for his device and updates his ride stop. I am almost in tears because I do not have the funds to get a Lyft from this point to my work but finally I was so defeated that I said to my daughter, ""I guess we need to get out."" He's not understanding that this ride had 2 stops. He's not understanding that I can give him the gps route to my work so then finally his app updates and he realizes that our ride was not finished and he drove us to work. I arrived and felt so bad I was almost in tears and I needed Uber to know even though he said sorry many times. I cannot believe this was my morning and how anxious and worried not having a ride to work that was paid for in advance and not being able to fund another ride because this driver couldn't communicate or understand his job. 
I barely made it to work on time and my daughter and I were so stressed by the time we arrived. I am so disappointed in Uber and this entire experience has left me in total confusion. This driver needs to be coached and trained. I would hate for someone else to go through this. I feel that if I hadn't been so persistent and if I would have just got out when this started I would still be in Gilbert at my husband's job trying to figure out how to get my daughter and I to work. This was a horrible stressful ride and no one should have to start their day like this. Emailed Uber and they gave me some generic statement of how they regret I had such a bad experience and stated that they hold their drivers to a high standard but nothing else was said. I wish I would have read reviews before I took my first ride.

We had a great driver last Sunday from LaGuardia to Times Square. The cost was $31. When I scheduled a pickup Friday for our ride back to LaGuardia the price was $51. After waiting for several hours to get some type of confirmation that we would be picked up, we ended up using yellow taxi which was only $45. Just be sure to compare $$ when you travel. Our yellow taxi driver we spoke to the night before at 9 pm said he would be waiting for us at our 4:30 am to pick us up, and there he was waiting when we came out at 4:30 am.

I love Uber. However, its customer service can do better. Read my Story. I have a fear of driving. As a result, for the last four years, I have used Uber almost every day to go everywhere; work, events, etc. I even use uber when I travel abroad. As an uber-veteran, I have experienced the good, the bad and the ugly. Yesterday, I forgot my phone in an uber vehicle. When I realized this, I used my room mate's phone to try to log into my account and contact the driver. However, I had forgotten my password. I decided to request a new one. That is where the trouble started. To help you retrieve your password, Uber has a two-step verification; they send you a four-digit code to your phone. This, of course, is for our safety. The problem is ""how do you get the code if you don't have your phone?"" The answer is easy. ""Customer service."" Right? Only mine was not so easy. 
Unlike most companies, Uber has NO PHONE HELPLINE for customers. All the numbers online are an automated robot sending you back to the app if you are not in a fatal accident. For almost five hours, I sat next to my computer trying to get help with this issue. Out of desperation, I even tweeted uber. Uber customer service from Twitter responded to my problem and nudged the email customer service before I could get a response. To make matters worse, the email customer service (after five hours) replied by sending me THE SAME LINK which requires the two-step verification. 
I am not able to go to work today since I can't uber there. To this point, I STILL haven't been helped. I wanted to cry, or yell. And I thought to myself, ""Who does that help""? I decided instead, to use my voice as a social media influencer, to reach out to all of you. I am confident there are others out there who have experienced this too. Together, we can ask the new CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi to implement an uber customer service helpline for everyday customers like myself. He can understand that typing back and forth for hours delay help for issues which only require a 5-minute phone call. Every other company does this: banks, restaurants, manufacturers, airlines, etc. SOLUTION Please sign this petition, so uber can see how many of its customers urgently need this feature. Thank you.

I tried Uber for the first time when I flew to Miami on Tuesday, June 26. I'm not familiar with Miami airport so I just followed the exit/ground transportation signs to get outside. Once outside and not being sure how to use Uber, I asked a stranger outside if he knew how to use Uber and he told me was requesting an Uber himself. When he was done he helped me request an Uber, and showed me how to follow the driver on the app. While I'm waiting, I see at least 12 to 15 other people being picked up by Uber and/or Lyft.
When the app the driver about 4 minutes away, I get a message telling me the driver had to cancel and they were sending another driver that would an upgrade for me at no additional charge. I followed the second driver on the app and when it showed him being 1 minute away I started looking out for his vehicle, a GMC Acadia. I then see that the app shows the driver has arrived, I'm looking everywhere and I do not see a GMC Acadia. I asked another gentleman a few feet away if he was familiar with Uber and told me he was and was waiting on an Uber himself. I showed him my phone stating the driver had arrived. He looked and said he didn't see a GMC Acadia either. He then told to call the driver and showed me how. 
I called the driver and he told me he was there and asked if I was downstairs. I said as far as I knew I was downstairs. He then asked if I saw any taxies waiting and I told him I did not see any taxies. He told me I needed to go down one more level where he was, and to hurry downstairs as the police were telling him he had to leave. I hurried downstairs and saw the GMC Acadia and finally got to his vehicle and hehe started off to my destination. Once he arrived to the street where my hotel was, he could not find the hotel. After 3 trips around the block I see a sign for the hotel's tavern and told him the hotel has to be there. He then told me to get out there and I did.
Two problems I have with Uber on my first and last experience with them. As I'm getting my expenses together for the trip to Miami, I reviewed the rides with Uber to print my receipts and saw they charged me a $6.00 cancellation fee for the first ""DRIVER"" who canceled. When I questioned it on the app, it stated the $6.00 would be issued as a credit the next time I use Uber. I did not see any way at all to request a refund to my card, I don't plan on ever using Uber again; so now I'm out the $6.00.
My second problem is I was charged a waiting fee for the driver who did pick me up because I had to go down one level where he was. When I got in his vehicle he told me Uber drivers can ONLY pick up on the lower level where the taxi stand is. I questioned about the 12 to 15 people I saw get picked up on the level I was originally on and he stated those drivers should not be picking up on that level. So now I paid an additional $15.00 (the waiting fee) on top of the $6.00 credit I have toward my next ride. I will not use Uber again, but I will try Lyft to see if they are any better. If not, I go old school and take taxies.

My wife and I took a train to NYC and when we got to the street a driver asked if we needed a Taxi which we said yes. When we got to his car we saw it was a SUV. I asked if he was an UBER driver and he said yes. I asked him to take us to the cruise ship terminal which was approx. 2 miles away. When we arrived he said that it would be $60.00 Yes $60.00. We were very disappointed because he did not give us a price to our destination. When the cruise was over we ended up taking a TAXI back to Penn center which we were charged $10.00.

My Uber arrived on time, car was clean though it reeked of cologne and had an overwhelming smell of either a car or a dog. I get in the car and get about a mile up the road and the Uber driver is heading in the direction of the neighboring county, though I'm in the next county in the complete opposite direction. I told him to turn around and go down a road heading in the correct direction to my home, but he blurted out, annoyed stating ""that road is shut down, and I can drop you off here and you can wait on the next Uber"". I stated that I was not getting out, and “I don't care which way you take”, it just better be $24.14 like Uber stated on their website, which I screenshotted. 
A 30 minute trip (when I'm driving, no tolls roads-either interstate or back roads), quickly turned into a 53 minute car ride. Going through lake county, though I left Seminole county to go to Orange county took me 13 miles out of my way. Not to mention, in Lake County while getting on the 429 till road, a car got in front of him (about 5 seconds reaction time) and instead of breaking, and allowing him to go, he kept speed while honking the horn, and cut the wheel hard, and got in the entrance bypassing him from the rear of the car. 
By that time I forced my seatbelt on! Ready to get out of the car with this weird ** man, I made him drop me off at the entrance of my complex. Relief and relaxation quickly went out of the window when I got home, charged my phone up and looked at my statements! Uber charged me $24.14 on my debit card, and ($3.00+3.00+6.00.6.00+39.67) $57.67 on my credit card. Livid is definitely an understatement to how I am feeling right now. Receipt is not showing on Uber's website yet, so I'm waiting until it posts on my credit card, and I vow this is my first and last time ever using Uber! I will stick with public transportation next time!

Take Uber services at your own risk! Drivers may hoodwink you into paying more or cash for a non-cash trip! Uber help will wash their hands off and refuse to even contact the driver to sort out the issue! U Bet and End up Risky! I took a trip which had a Rs.75/- coupon applied. At the end of the trip Uber displayed Rs.279.82/- The driver asked me to pay what is displayed on the screen because he is unable to see it on his screen. I paid him 280/- and left the car. When I checked the Uber receipt, I found the trip cost to be only Rs.204.82/- I contacted the driver who offered to return the money; but later retracted. Uber also said they are unable to help. Uber displays two rates for a single trip; one higher and the other lower but displayed only in the receipt section. You will first notice the higher amount and pay!!! A system designed to allow drivers to take more money.
In the second instance, I selected PayTm as payment option. The driver requested me to pay in cash at the end of the trip, and I obliged. The amount is still shown as OUTSTANDING. I called the driver and recorded his voice. He confirmed as having paid the amount. But, Uber still insists that I pay online too for the same trip. They didn't want to contact the driver to solve the issue when the matter is still fresh in his mind. For all my complaints they give the same reply!!! U Bet and End up Risky???

I set up an Uber account. Great! (or so I thought) I used the service frequently, always maintained a score of 5.0 clearly displayed on my account beside my picture in my profile. I had to factory reset my phone, could not get my account back. Tried to re-register and was told my phone number was already in use. Received an email after finding some random way to complain through their app and was told the agent had to enter my account and set my phone number. Fine, no problem. Started off with a new account and went to add my picture and could not. I emailed back the same agent at which point he referred to me as a driver. I used Uber 4 times and just had a random email sent to me from Uber showing my score suddenly at a 4.87. How, I have no idea. I tipped, was friendly, showed up on time, gave 5 stars. My account still does not let me add my picture and does not show my score. 
Meanwhile, in order to contact Uber, you can only do so through the app and they just list topics that they think you might want to complain about or need help with, my topic apparently wasn't one of them. Uber has to step up their customer support program. IT IS NOT WORKING. And this rating system is not a fair rating system apparently either. Drivers, nor riders cannot see who rated them or why. How can you improve when you don't even know the rules of the game? You would think that with so much happening to Uber that Customer Support would be better. It's just common sense guys.

Uber needs to be shut down. They treat the drivers unfairly also the riders. I'm always being short paid instead they increase the service fee. How is it that they get paid more than me on a trip.

So generally, I prefer Lyft over Uber mainly because over time it became apparent to me that Lyft has a better attitude towards its customers than Uber. And my suspicion was confirmed a few months ago when the story broke about sexual harassment claims at Uber and how they were handled. Until now though, I had never really experienced first-hand the callous nature of Uber's leadership. Here is my story:
I ordered an Uber to take me from my hotel to the airport and since I had time on my hands I ordered the Pool. When the driver arrived, the older gentleman, whose English was not too good - for which I am not judgmental as an immigrant myself - seems somewhat confused about whether or not I was his passenger. It seemed that the first rider who was in the vehicle was also headed to the same airport so the gentleman thought he had already picked up the airport passenger. After some back-and-forth discussion I decided politely to just take a taxi from the hotel and let the driver go on about his business.
Shortly after I arrived at the airport I checked my Uber app only to realize that I had been charged for the ride, which, of course, I didn't take. So I immediately filed a request with Uber technical support for a refund. Not 10 minutes later, tech support replied and informed me that their records indicate that a trip from the given source and destination as I requested had indeed taken place so they could not issue me a refund. What basically happened is that the driver didn't cancel my portion of the ride so it appeared that both passengers were on the trip.
I replied with a scathing reprimand asking them to do their due diligence and contact the driver to confirm that I did not take the trip before making a judgment and suggesting that I was being dishonest. And it seems that this prompted them to act and shortly after they replied apologetically and indeed issued me a refund.
My issue here is not the older gentleman, whose accent was not so great and appeared about the trip, or the encumbered cost of the trip, but rather the dismissiveness I experienced from Uber when I filed a complaint. Without any due diligence they made a judgment assuming I was in the wrong and then dismissed my case. As I noted in my scathing follow-up to them, that attitude is typical of the toxic Uber culture, which played out none more horribly than callous way in which they dealt with complaints from female employees about sexual harassment. 
It seems to be an institutional norm for them that 'they are right and you are wrong.' It's very condescending and vexing to be made subject to that sort of attitude. I think it has no place in the industry. Needless to say, I deleted the Uber app and will resume using Lyft, as I did after the scandal. I actually only recently started using Uber again because they offered a discount on up to 10 rides. Shame on you Uber. You all need to tighten up.

Got an Uber me and my friends on 6/9/18 at 3:03 am -3:30am. I was seated on the front passenger seat while playing music from my phone via the car's aux cable. When we got dropped I got out to help my friend who was seated at the back seat to get into the building. Before entering the building I realized that had left my phone in the Uber. After getting inside the building I attempt to call the Uber driver but he ignored all my calls. The phone rung but he never picked up. I called the driver multiple times and left him several voice mails to call me back. But he never called back. I went ahead and contacted Uber customer service and they informed me they've notified the driver about my phone. However, the driver stated he did not see any phone. But after tracking my phone it showed the device was in the Uber and got turned off 10 mins after he had dropped us... Such drivers are giving Uber a bad reputation."

I was delivering for a client when she had forgotten to put her hotel room number down, I gladly advised her that she would have to come downstairs to pick up her food, at which case she did, however the very next day, I was told my account would be placed on hold for 24hrs because she suspected my car to smell like weed. I advised Uber I would take a drug test and do anything needed to suffice the allegation, however Uber decided upon themselves to shut down my driving status for not 24 but 48hrs instead... Uber lies, and so does the customer's supposed allegation that can't be proven... There should be protocol for things of that nature, however there aren't. This matter could have been dealt a little better, and cleared up and resolved, however I did not get that kind of approach from their hubs, nor their support system. Uber has a bad track record for unresolved issues, in my opinion, and that's the way they like it..."

Yesterday, I took an Uber from Union, NJ to Staten Island,NY ($45 ride). The Uber driver allegedly spilled some rice, took a picture and then nailed my credit card for a $145 cleaning fee.

Beware anyone who rides with UBER. They are dealing in FRAUDULENT practices!!! For 3 weeks now I was offered the Ride to Earn Savings... 9 rides for a certain percentage of ride the following week. Each week I have taken 10 or more rides. In one day I took 6 Ubers but got credit for only one!!! This week, although I earned the ride savings and have 20 rides that are supposed to be discounted UBER still REFUSES to apply THEIR PROMOTION!!! They keep responding with, ""Sorry while we look into this response."" ALL the while I cannot use my promotion. 
I am going to every media outlet, BBB, and attorney general with my complaint. IT IS ILLEGAL TO ADVERTISE AND NOT HONOR YOUR PROMOTIONS UBER!!! ""In fact, in many countries true “bait and switch” has been made illegal through different forms of consumer protection legislation. In the United States, for example, consumers can file a lawsuit against a marketer for false advertising if they're using the technique.""

Yesterday, I took an Uber from the airport (43 dollar ride). The uber driver allegedly poured a liquid on the seat, took a picture and then nailed my credit card for a 150 dollar cleaning fee. The ride took place in the morning and I do not drink. Uber said sorry. I apparently am not the only one that has experienced this Uber money making plan.

Not only was my driver unable to find me, we had to wait on the avenue rather than in front of the building where we were staying. On our trip home the driver went a roundabout way and that extended the trip by 8 miles plus the extra charge for the time. The original fare quote was changed. I understand charging for tolls but I don't want to contribute to some drivers fund that's tacked on at the bottom of the receipt. We are going back to car service where the fees are set. No surprises. No more $121. one way trips to NYC."

On 6/7/2018 I used my Uber gift card to try to book a ride. As I was booking my ride it depleted my gift card of $45. I was left with $4.71 in my account. And then it asked me to confirm: I did and it said ""oops something went wrong. You don't have enough credits. Use another payment method."" I have been trying to get my $45 returned to me and they won't respond to my emails. NOTE: this was my 2nd time trying to use Uber and it completely failed. Not only did I not receive their services.

Uber to and From McCarren International Las Vegas - The driver sat in front of the wrong house and I had to go retrieve him. I was charged a waiting fee!! On my return home from a trip using UBER. The fare was much greater, the driver took about 20 minutes to arrive and then drove a bizarre route taking an extra 15 minutes!! They say the fee was the same however the fee was based on the distance from the airport to my home. I will not use UBER again."

Friday - June 8th, 2018 - Uber SUCKS… Big Tim!!! This has happened last year also. Today, early morning, I loaded another $50.00 on my Uber Account (but the app did not even show the two cards I loaded, or my previous balance, which was almost $100.00), around 7:00 a.m. Around noon I tried to get an Uber Ride, but the Uber app would NOT acknowledge me!!! The app kept asking me if I wanted to open an Uber Account, but I already have one, and I know my log-in perfectly.
There is NO Customer Service phone number or E-mail Address!!! WTF kind of Customer Service is that!!! Uber > YOU SUCK Big Time!!! I wanted to use up my Uber Credit, but I cannot depend on Uber to even get a ride!!! Late for work, late for doctor's appointments!!! Lyft will continue to be my BEST ride service!!! Uber gets a Big FAT > Zero Rating. Get your act together Uber > You SUCK!!! 
Last year the same thing happened when I tried to get a ride, but Uber app did NOT even acknowledge me!!! I had over $150.00 (US) on my Uber account, but could not get a ride. Error message said something was wrong with my bank account, but there was nothing wrong with my bank account!!! Uber Sucks Big Time!!! The absolute WORST Customer Service in my life (and I've seen some pretty bad customer service)... They have NO Customer Service!!! Can't get any worse than that, can you!!!

The map to walk to the pickup point was COVERED IN UBER NOTICES plus what little of the map I could see lacked any street names next to me, nor did uber provide directions on where to walk, nor were the dots accurate (perhaps it wanted me to use the backdoor because those dots sure didn't make sense walking out the front door) and Uber did NOT provide an exact physical address for me to google. Worst, is uber provides NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM and now uber charges me a $5 cancellation fee for a $2.78 ride? Seriously - this IS fraudulent!

Check your bill, if you take different trips write it down and what they charge you. We used it to go to work and home. Price should have been the same every day. Monthly bill came and there were several off prices about 6 we found. You call, give them info and 3-4 days later they call and say, ""ok, we can deduct it or give you a credit for further rides."" Myself, I would have liked to know how they got so screwed up but they offered no explanation for that. A few drivers don't speak English but our drive was easy. Good company.

Yesterday Uber had charged me $43.70 for 20 minutes 8.1 miles long drive that we were making two times a week for the past 2 years and usually costed us $18-21. I have contacted Uber and they claim that the charge is justified because it happened during alleged peak hours and after back and forth correspondence offered to credit me back 25% of that charge, which is still way too high. Let us run the numbers. Effectively, what Uber is trying to say by defending this charge of $43.70 for 20 minute 8.1 miles long ride is that your driver is making $131.10/hour that would translate into $272,480 annual salary!!! Really? An executive salary for the taxi drivers and you are expecting the general public to believe this nonsense!?! Which percent of this revenue the driver is actually going to see?
With all due respect, everybody knows how much Uber drivers are making and it is nowhere close to the figure calculated above. This is a pure profit for corporate Uber not a stayed “incentive” to its drivers. We were making the same identical ride for over two years and the price increased from $15 - to up to $21, which could be justified by gas prices fluctuations. Yesterday, during the same time Uber was giving me a lower rate for a direct ride from my office in a neighboring state for 3 times longer trip for the same destination. Uber needs to stop ripping off its customers!!! This is a sure way to destroy company business reputation and consequently to lose business. 
The ONLY reason to why people are using Uber is a perceived superior value compared to the competition to the end customer, this is what their entire business model is based on. The company should NOT use “peak hour argument” to justify ridiculous charges! I hope this review is helpful for customers who had similar experiences. Be very careful about recent unjustified ridiculously high prices.

I usually purchase a Uber Gift Card to run weekly errands as Uber. The reason why I use that method was because every time I used my bank card Uber puts a ridiculous hold on my card causing my bank account to be overdrawn. To combat that issue I started purchasing the Uber Gift Card. This past weekend, I was preparing to go grocery shopping and tried requesting for an Uber using my gift card credit. This was a short trip literally 4 blocks at that. I received a message saying try a new payment method, so I said I will add another Uber gift card. That didn't work, so I called a local cab to pick up me up and take me to the store. I thought it may have been an issue with the application, so I went on shopping. I had already placed money on the gift card and wanted to use it to get back home. Another message advising me I must add a new payment method. 
At that point I was furious because my bank card was not working. I eventually had to use Lyft as my groceries were melting in the 93 degree heat. I sent numerous messages on Sunday and they continue to give me these lame feedback. I have requested for a refund. Nothing digital. A check because I have 50 dollars credit in Uber I cannot use.

My first time ordering was GREAT! Ordered from McDonald’s. With normal traffic it takes 7-9 mins from my place. First time food was mediocre warm but I do expected that. Driver was great, friendly and for price I thought, ""Yep. I’ll be using this, though I wish they had more food choices for our area."" Placed order on 3/22 at 2:46 pm. Food delivered 3:20 and as I said mediocre warm (as I expected so no biggy). My latest order on 5/28/18 I placed order same restaurant at 9:01 pm food was delivered at 9:27 pm so 26 mins later versus the 32 mins from 1st order and the food was cold as if it came out of fridge. 
Now norm I would blame restaurant but issue is not only was food cold the bags felt as if they had been in a fridge. I honestly believe the driver had the food sitting in direct contact with her AC as it was in the 90s that day. When I complained to Uber Eats' customer service I was told to rate restaurant but I tried 4x to explain I don’t believe it was restaurant's error due to bags being cold that I believed it was driver. I was then accused 2x of wanting free food/refund WHICH AT NO TIME DID I ASK FOR SUCH!!! What’s the point of customer service and a category “issues with my food” if only answer they have is rate the restaurant/driver! So I’ll be using OrangeCrate etc and good luck to anyone. Hope you have a better experience.

My wife decided to start driving for Uber and Lyft this summer as a means of earning a small amount of additional income. Sadly she's been made to realize this was a major mistake. At least on the Uber side of things. We live in Tucson, Arizona, and on the Uber site it states that our city has no fee associated with vehicle inspection. However, after signing up and getting all her ducks in a row she came to find that her account had a negative -$20 balance. She has since called five times and been told each time that she will be credited within 24 to 72 hours. She's even gotten emails indicating this will occur. Yet here we are two weeks later and nothing has happened. 
She feels dumb since she's given rides for the company and realizes these were at her own expense since it seems they will never be crediting her for their own internal error. I'm deeply enraged by this subject as my wife deserves to be treated as an outstanding employee and shouldn't have to call Uber several times without them taking action to help her out of an issue that was in no way created due to fault of her own. If someone from Uber reads these please contact us to correct the above complaint.

I used Uber two years ago in Philly multiple times and never had a problem. Had no need to use them again until the third week in May 2018. Logged into the app and scheduled a ride. Everything went well and the driver arrived as expected. I took my ride, tipped the driver in cash (who was very nice and polite) and thought that was the end of it. When I got my emailed receipt, the ride was $10 more than it should have been! I contacted Uber through email to resolve and they claimed that I chose the ""Uber XL"" trip, which was more $$ (I have to assume because my driver came in a newer Cadillac Escalade?), but I ABSOLUTELY did NOT choose that ride option when I booked it. I remember seeing it as an option, but that's not what I wanted nor chose. 
I sent them emails THREE TIMES explaining that I never chose that more expensive option but they could CARE LESS... I explained that even if I HAD chosen the wrong trip, the right thing to do (to keep a customer happy) would be to refund me anyway, but they simply REFUSED... I even told them that I was going to share my experiences with Uber online, but it mattered NOT to them. So here we are... As evidenced by the other bad reviews, I am clearly not alone.

This was our first time using Uber - My husband wanted a ride to and from Smart Financial Center for an event. We had difficulty getting the first attempt at making a future reservation to take and ended up with someone on the way on the wrong day. We cancelled that ride successfully and was billed $10 for the cancellation. The next day we successfully got the reservation set up for the pick up.
The driver was great and service exceptional. The problem, however was that my husband's AMEX card was charged two $1 charges, a $75.24 charge on the failed try, a $15 charge on the trip day, an $89.02 charge at 6:30 pm and then an $89.62 charge at 7:40 pm, and finally a $128.57 charge on the return trip. The accounting in My Trips only shows the valid charges and the AMEX hits are currently pending. However the fact that the card was hit so many times alerted the fraud division of AMEX and they shut down the card until they could contact us.

While working for Uber, Uber gives you the option to do InstaPay so you can cash out up to 5 times a day, they boast, they also charge you $0.50 per transaction.

I’ve been driving for Uber for a while. I believe Uber is faking its surges to charge more to customers during masked high demand times (customers pay more when demand is high during surges, however, per my experience there is considerably less demand or enough drivers showed up in the area that there is no reason to increase the rates during those surge times). I will make it simple. The following happened many time so I can tell that it was definitely not an error occasion, but a strategy to increase rates at surge times.
So, here is the case. I am right in the middle of surge. Let’s say it showed me 2.0x and I was accepting trips. The surge jumped to more than 3.0x. Within next 5-10 minutes I still could not get any trips. If I was there and could receive the trip why people would be charged more showing high demand. I am calling authorities for a review on this. By the way my acceptance and satisfaction rate was high enough to blame (*4.9+).

Let me tell you first I’m a very nice and educated lady, and I’m driving a Uber for a month part time, while waiting for summer semester to start. I rarely complain and write bad reviews. But now I can’t remain silent. Uber owners, you don’t care of your drivers at all! You pay us $12 per hour (on average), it’s a shame!! Because I will not drive anyone for $ 12, minus I using my car, so basically it’s $9 per hour BEFORE taxes!! I did Pool Uber, I drove 1 hour 30 minutes nonstop, and guess what they paid me? $ 21! Minus gas, it’s $ 16-18! And riders are very demanding, especially when they are in the POOL, and after all “turn here, stop there, give me water, air conditioning on a cold day“ they don’t leave tips!!! 
Dear Uber riders, please, at least leave $2 tip for your driver!! Especially when you live in luxury downtown and demand stuff from your poor Uber driver! We get only 50% from what you actually pay to Uber! Uber, make 20% tips mandatory, otherwise you’re taking advantage of us, your drivers who trying to make ends meet! You’re using not only our cheap work, but also destroy our new cars, and we got paid $9-12 before taxes??? Cleaning houses for $20 per hour is much easier than driving Uber. Uber, wake up!!

On vacation in Hollywood, Fl a month ago and needed a ride to Miami Cruise Port. DoubleTree Hotel recommended an Uber ride to Port. Signed up, created account, and driver arrived across street. No worries, we pulled our luggage to her. She was a young Spanish girl, barely spoke English, beautiful new car. Off she went on interstate, barreling along UNTIL traffic called to a screeching halt. She slammed brakes, skidded into left lane and with horns honking, barely missed getting hit from every direction. She shook her hands upset and started up again with traffic.
Barreling again, following too close, this time slams brakes and was inches away from hitting car in front. I yelled at her to slow down, stop following close and pay attention. I had a feeling it was the end of our lives. Our fault for not having her immediately pull off exit ramp and let us out. We made it to Port safely afterwards, but God was on our side because she had zero skills driving on interstate. We came so close to be killed. I will never use the company again. Next time, I will use a van service or taxi. Not worth the extra money saved. I will never forget the trip through hell.

I ordered an Uber in Albany NY this morning. I selected Albany Airport as my destination. The driver arrived on time in a car that seemed dingy and small but it was supposed to be a short ride so no problem. Except that it turned out not to be a short ride at all. To reach the airport, he needed to take a right out of the parking lot and then another left at the major intersection. It's knew that it was that simple to find and I had only been in the city 3 days. He took a left out of the parking lot and I questioned him as I knew that was wrong. 
I couldn't understand his answer but assumed he knew some back way (which wouldn't be necessary as traffic was very light). I became more concerned as he drove on some obscure back roads and eventually arrived at an empty dead end on the opposite side of a field. Presumably it was still airport grounds, I don't know, but would only be for offsite workers and not passengers. He blamed the Uber GPS and said (nicely) that I didn't make the correct Albany Airport selection when I ordered my ride.
It may be that because Uber has multiple locations for the Albany airport that I could have accidentally selected the wrong one but I was from out of town and had no reason to believe that when I selected Albany Airport. I would need to analyze further. Nonetheless, the driver should have at least possessed a passing knowledge of where the airport is. He knew I was a passenger going to the airport to catch a flight and I had my bags with me. Regardless of what the GPS said, they should have used common sense to get me to the airport terminal. What should have been a 5 miles drive and a matter of minutes took a full 25 minutes and covered 13.5 miles. I should have called a taxi because in all my travels I've never encountered a cab driver who didn't know how to go to the airport. And $22 for a short trip in a crappy car is no bargain.

Ordering a future UBER ride and it scheduled the ride for immediately. While trying to contact driver, got message that said to leave a message. He was in front of the house before I could cancel, so I was billed $5.00 for a cancelled ride. The UBER company APP is lousy when it comes to scheduling advance rides, furthermore, when the driver arrives before you can cancel, you are still billed for the call. When trying to contact UBER directly, you cannot do it. No number exists for the city in which you are scheduling the ride and no number exists for a one to one contact to explain your situation. The only number is a help option but it does not work for complaints, only for emergencies. Not going to use Uber in the future."

Poor service and a rip-off! Yesterday I requested Uber ride service at 8:34am. At 8:37am they confirmed the request and advised the car and driver and pick up location, which was a street corner 5 minutes walk from my home, which I thought was odd for not picking me up at my home. My wife and I stood there in the direct sun waiting... then the Uber App sent me notice saying it would be another 4 minutes wait... then another notice saying it would be another 5 minutes... then another notice saying it would be 13 minutes... then another notice saying it would be 19 minutes. 
I tried to contact the driver directly using the Uber App and sent message to the driver but no response from the driver and then the Uber App sent me a notice saying my session timed out and next thing I know is that Uber charged me a $6+ ride cancellation fee... and I did not even cancel nor did the driver show up and we were stranded, missing out on our appointment and having our entire day ruined. 
Uber is really screwed up and in reading this morning about Uber reviews on Consumer Affairs and in Facebook I can clearly see that we are not the only people having such problems with Uber. It seems that at least 80% of the reviews are negative and that many times Uber and/or the driver submit falsified reports of extra charges against the consumer. I will never again use Uber and recommend that anyone even considering Uber to do their research and take heed in those negative reviews, which are a direct reflection of Uber service, in my opinion - poor and unsatisfactory in the least and a fraud in the worst.

I’ve been using Uber for a couple of years now, and I’ve got to say I’m disappointed with their customer service. I had a pool driver who never came, and as a result, I had to order a different more expensive Uber driver (at 3x the price) to get to my location on time, like I would have had the driver come on time or I had taken the train. I contacted customer service (which is a hassle in itself) and asked to be refunded the difference but was told that they “appreciated the feedback” but that I should have tried to use a pool or something if I was uncomfortable with the price. I’m now using Lyft because I don’t have these sorts of problems."

26 April, 2018, Maryland, USA. I ordered an Uber to Dulles airport. There was no incident during the trip that resulted to a damage or spillage... No vomiting, no eating, no drinking. Beverages. I drank bottled water only. When we were dropped off at the airport, the driver did not complain of any damages neither were they any damage to his car’s interior and exterior. He even dusted his entire car in our presence before taking off while we loaded our luggages in the cart. However, 12 days after the trip, Uber deducted and extra $80 from my account as cleaning fee. After writing to them and demanding clarity, I was sent a picture of a huge mess on one of the car seats. If my mom or older sister or myself made such a mess, it could not have been hidden. I am so shocked by the picture and its source. A vomit of this nature cannot go unnoticed.
I find this unacceptable and disturbing because Uber seems to abuse riders' credit cards just because it is registered in their system. This is gross violation. If they do not refund this money within 1 month then I will close the Uber account never to be used again. Shame on you Mr. ** in the USA with Honda Pilot ** for such a disgusting act. You came across as a good driver but you have disgraced yourself by charging me for something unjustly and even sending false evidence. We did not mess your car. None of us ate, or vomited in the car. None of our luggages even leaked because all the luggages were intact after the 22 hours flight back to my country. God is watching you! Uber is a joke for acting without verifying their facts.

Saturday, May 5th late morning, I used Uber for a 20 minute drive from my home to a high school where my chorus was performing a concert. I have used Uber a number of times in the past with positive results. I carried only a light suit bag with me. No food or drinks. I agreed to the $17 fare and was delivered without any delays. Later in the day, my email showed a double charge...two $17 charges at exactly the same time...an honest error, I thought. The next morning they emailed to notify they were correcting my charge to add an $80 cleaning fee! I am disputing this, but the truth is the driver was creating extra charges. I didn't spill or do anything to his vehicle, nor did he advise me of adding a cleaning fee. He complained endlessly during the trip of his late car payment. I won't use Uber again since this is a nearly impossible dispute. They apparently accept the drivers word with no proof."

If you’re planning to use Uber, beware of extra added fees and know that the app is not easily understandable. You can only book a ride using their app. It does not allow you to review your ride before purchasing it. You are booking a ride unaware that you have booked it. A car shows up, you get charged and if you're not there, you get charged a $5.00 cancellation fee. Drivers are supposed to call or text you when they arrive, but some don’t. They drive off because you can’t find them and you get charged for the ride and another late fee. There are no human beings available to talk to when you have problems. You have to manoeuvre around in their app to send an email to customer service. This company is a money making rip off. I would not recommend using it, especially if you’re not familiar with apps."

I am a driver on the Uber platform and have driven in Chicago, Illinois. Recently had my account put on hold due to a ""report of possible impairment while driving"". This is total B.S. I don't even use drugs or Alcohol. This is very disturbing for someone to write an untruthful report. I have given out over 4,000 rides and have over 2,000 5-star ratings. I receive all types of race and gender related ignorance and biases and I am vulnerable at all times unless I protect myself while I am on the road. Uber allows passengers to make false reports that affect the driver, but has no way for the driver to protect themselves from the false attacks. After research it's a drastically common issue on the Uber platform. I suggest anyone looking to drive for Uber understand that while you are an independent contractor for Uber, you will still suffer the consequences of the reality that Uber is ran like a private correctional facility.

HUGE WARNING TO UBER USERS!!! I will never use UBER again - every time I tried to add my home address, it would find it on the map and then when I would try and add it to my favorites, it kept adding a different address with the same street name in Toronto. I live in Chelsea QC 4.5 hours away!!! But that wasn't clear from their app because on the list of favorites it only shows the street name and not the town. 
When I first got in the Uber car, the guy went, ""WOW, you want a drive from here to Toronto... That's 4.5 hrs"". He had to manually enter the address in his system. Then when I selected a 15% tip at the end of the trip, it calculated it on a fare for the original 4.5 hour trip. The $62 flashed by and I said wait a minute... It can't be that much? He showed me that the fare was $14 on his system and Uber only adds 20% so it will be less than $20. I said, ""Are you sure?"" He said yes. I felt dumb because it was only the second time I had used Uber so got out. After he left, I double checked my phone and saw that yes the fair was $20 but a tip of $62 was added even though I chose the 15% tip option. It must have calculated it on the original 4.5 hour fair. Now they will only give me a credit on my Uber account and NOT a refund on my card. On top of that his car was old and rattled although he was nice enough. The whole experience was bad. BEWARE!!!

I’ve only recently started using Uber for rides to and from work or to the next city over to visit close friends being that I do not have a car anymore. I’ve noticed inconsistencies in the fares as well as being blamed for the mistakes that drivers are making or that the “Uber GPS” makes. I was charged over $40 from my house to the house of a friend 10 miles away and the same ride was the same distance where I was taken 10 miles home. The ride home only cost me $21. How the HELL did it climb an extra $20? Especially when my driver got lost and passed my drop-off route. I sent a complaint hoping to get a price adjustment and was told that I basically should have told my driver not to get lost. As if it was my fault that they continued to pass my drop off point which was clearly made known before my pick up in the first place. Goodbye Uber and hello Lyft."

Previously, I loved Uber. I am a long haul driver and can park my tractor trailer somewhere and Uber to get food or sightsee. Here is my horror story. I'm telling it because if you use Uber, you might also want to have a Lyft account on standby. I went to IKEA in Cincinnati. After shopping, I logged in to get a ride back to my tractor 4 miles away. My payment was denied. What had happened, according to Citibank, Uber hit my card 10 times for a zero dollar amount, therefore shutting it down due to fraudulent activity. Finally, as my phone was running out of battery life, and it was getting darker and colder outside, I was able to choose a method they did take. This can happen, and the Citibank rep informed me that Uber does this a lot. Lyft not so much. If you use Uber have alternate transportation set up. If you are sightseeing know how to get back to where you need to go. Uber WILL leave you stranded."

Ubereats - My older daughter ordered food from this service, and as far as I can gather the driver, from the street, spotted her younger sister (16) on the front stoop. Not sure if he thinks he's a junior g-man or what, but he called the police and reported a child endangerment issue for her strawberry hemangioma. In case you don't know, that's a birthmark. It's not even that pronounced, and he was in his car. After a visit from the police, who seemed puzzled by the non-issue and reported everything ok - I guess it turns out not to be a police issue to have a birthmark. So, I decide to complain to the company. Guess what - NO CONTACT NUMBERS OR EMAILS available - at all. Make of that what you will. They are not welcome at my house anymore."

I went on Google and searched ""Uber Executive Emails"" and boom! There was emails for some of the executives. I wrote an email to one of the VP's about the issues I was having and also cut and pasted all the communication I had with their customer service. One day later...I received an email from customer service with an apology and the issue was resolved! 
Sometimes, you just have to go to the top and state your case. I respect the executives at Uber for listening to my issue and getting it resolved. Now, I hope I don't have to go to the top again and customer service/driver support will change for the better.

I started driving Uber when they opened the in Tampa, Florida market. I was issued an iPhone to utilize for driver tools. I drove a few times but quit since I was not getting the business Uber had advertised. Anyway, I received notification that they were going to charge fees for using it or I could use my smartphone for no fee. I returned the iPhone and did not drive for about 2 years.
I decided to drive part time with Uber so I reapplied and was approved. I drove for a 1 day and when I went to earnings, I was in debt to Uber $365.00! A fee they kept charging me for the iPhone I returned! I contacted driver support and they asked me for tracking number, proof I sent it back, etc. I replied and told then it has been close to 2 years and I have no documentation.
I suggested they go back on their server and locate ALL of the communication they had with me since I signed up as a driver. They keep asking me for more details with screenshots. Really??? You'd assume a company like Uber should have everything on back up servers since there is NO PHONE NUMBER to call. Anyway, I have contacted them requesting a manager to call me. NOTHING!!! My personal information was hacked at Uber and did they compensate for not protecting my information? No! But they want to charge me fees for equipment I returned and say nothing for 2 years and let fees accumulate??? Customer and Driver Support services are unsatisfactory and I am requesting my information be deleted from their database and drive for their competitor. I will keep you posted on how Uber resolves my issue.

I starting using again recently. I noticed my personal checking account balance was getting lower. I checked my statement online and Uber had been charging my personal bank card, and not my preferred business card which is my selected card. My personal card was only to used if my business account had low funds which was not the case. Uber insisted for 2 weeks that if I gave them the dates and times of the rides, they would reverse those payments, and charge the correct card. They did not do that, and then started asking to provide all of that information again and I had already done that 4 times.
They did send me an email for one of the charges, but all Uber did was charge my business card and jacked up the ride and my tip, so I was not only charged twice, but also more than the original rate and tip a week later. Then I received a call from a man stating he was with Dun and Bradstreet and wanted me to take a survey. When I asked him what the survey is for, he said ""This is about your complaint to Uber. Didn't you recently dispute something?"" I hung up. That is creepy. How does a telemarketer know that I ride with Uber or ANYTHING else about me. Uber data breach? So besides Uber ripping me off, I now have to worry that someone obtained my information through Uber.

Upon calling he mentioned the passenger was getting late and could not wait. I asked him how will he return my phone he asked me to call back. On calling he mentioned that I need to pay 20 rupees per kilometer to come and deliver the phone accepted. Tried calling him the full day. Finally he said shall come in the evening. Called him evening. He said, ""Have left. Please pay me. Am coming."" Accepted. Waiting. Still not arrived. 
Time is 8.30 pm 12 hrs without my phone is a loss of 12 lac Indian rupees to me. Understand it is my fault but what fails me is 1) he has to check if all belongings are taken once customer leaves 2) if he finds has to call or at least ask people around giving description of the person sitting behind and got out. 3) call Uber office and register saying found phone.

On April 16th, I purchased a $10 Uber gift card to add to my credits to ensure I had enough credits to go to store and back home. This brought my credit balance to 13.50, one way ride was $6, therefore, I would have the $12 total to cover there and back, well I thought. On attempt to confirm ride home I had no credits remaining, even after the first ride receipt only showed $6. This left me stranded and having to walk 4 miles home because I had no more payment options. Contacted Uber via email when made it home. They gave me some dumb excuse about an authorization hold on an additional $6 to ensure there was enough on payment method to cover trip. Well first of all, this policy relates to debit or credit card use, and secondly, I've ride many times using gift cards and this never happened. Well they continued to reply saying the hold was released and I should contact my bank. HILARIOUS... what bank... idiots, I used YOUR UBER gift card. 
Then they tell me the hold should have been released and credited back to my Uber account within a couple of hours. Well it's been 2 days, still nothing. The fact that this business is willing to lose a 5 star regular customer over $6 says a lot about how much they value your business. It isn't amount the amount for me, it is the inconvenience of being stranded and having to walk 4 miles home, after purchasing a gift card to ensure I have enough credits to cover this. Moral of story, if you are using an UBER gift card to cover your UBER ride make sure you purchase DOUBLE the amount because they will put an ""authorization hold"" on one amount and then deduct another charge of same amount. And do nothing to rectify the situation. A very comical and shady business practice. I've included screenshots of them advising me to contact my bank. UNBELIEVABLE!!!

When we arrived at our drop off destination another simple 21 miles away our ending fare was $124.42... Confused I contacted Uber since this was our first time using the service and I was told that the fare was correct and they up the prices at night to encourage drivers to be there. I was told there was nothing they could do and was assured that the fare was correct. 
After several messages later they credited my account $31.10 to make up for the misunderstanding which does me no good because I will never use their service again. It would be worth staying sober the whole night and driving everyone home for the price it ended up costing us grand total with tips. Our drivers were very good and safe though. Nothing against them.

I don't understand why Uber expect you to pay the driver for a trip when they have taken you to the wrong place. Because the drive GPS pick the wrong locate. I think that a Driver should check the locate where you're going when you live in a Big city when there a lot of places that sound and spell the same. Very dissatisfied. Very dissatisfied.

I booked cab at 11 pm but the cab not at all moving towards my pickup location. I called driver so many times, but he was unable to pickup the call. Still I waited for 20 mins after I cancelled the ride. For this I need to bear cancellation fee. This is happened for so many times. My issue is not with fee and all. It's all about night time waiting for a ride after so many hours of journey."

Wait time fee assessed being the following conditions are true. I ordered the Uber in the exact location I was standing when the Uber arrived. The Uber driver did NOT await on me one second as I was waiting in an obvious location that is easily visible from anywhere in the parking lot. According to the policy, although the driver didn’t wait for me - I was the one who waited. “A fee will be begin a few minutes after your driver arrives” & “We will notify you that a charge has started”. Neither of these conditions occurred.
This seems to be a regular shady practice. This isn’t normally something I would notice however since it occurred before I was reviewing the bill. It’s bad enough they charge all these surcharges and fees when it’s clearly not high/volume or peak times (you can see Uber’s in area). They also charge duplicate charges (base fare, distance, time, booking fee) there all for the same thing. It’s ridiculous that I go to the same place at same time every week and the price deviates such significant percentages. This is not the 1st time this wait time charge was assessed when I was waiting outside.

I had ordered a Uber cab and when I ordered it the fee was around $6, however once I arrived at my destination I received a notice that they had charged me extra fees without my knowledge or permission. I contacted them about this through Twitter and somehow my complete order was changed to the larger car, which I did not order. I guess they don't know that people get notifications when another device logs into your account because I received a notification that someone in Orange County had logged into my Uber account."

When I first started riding with Uber a year ago the price was OK and when they were ""surging"" it was usually early morning, holidays and late night. Now it seems like the surging is constant. Price is one thing and another minute later it's ten dollars or more higher and it's not even a holiday or early morning or weather conditions. Drivers are charging fees for things that haven't happened, like spills, cleaning fees, burnt cigarettes. I don't smoke, but I learned early on always take pictures before and after your trips 'cause drivers will try to get you. They aren't ending trips on time, they're canceling without even getting close to the pickup spot. This company is out of control in pricing and driver and company customer service.
I have a car but I use to use them if I didn't want to pay high parking fees. But believe me it's so much cheaper 'cause you never know when Uber is ""surging"" which is all hours of the day, even though on my phone map it will show numerous cars sitting close by but they're in high demand. Yeah okay. I'm done with these ride sharing apps. They are scamming and it's too much to get your money returned 'cause there's no one to talk to. Emailing them take forever. Good luck to anyone needing them. This company should be held to some sort of laws about how much they can charge on a short or long trip. $95.05 for a 3.3 mile trip is ridiculous. And then they want you to tip, and I'm one who believes in that. But tipping is based upon service, and to me Uber is not delivering that anymore.

I've been using Uber for 2 years now. They started off as a great company but they've been steadily increasing their fares. I have noticed a trend with them as of recently. Several Uber drivers will sit in a parking lot and do nothing and jacked up the prices of rides. I go just under 3 miles to work and just under three miles back home. Not a very long distance but they tried to charge me as much as $40 S4 just 3 miles. 
They often go to the wrong place and blame me for it when I clearly tell them where to go and now they charged a wait fee as well. I think there should be a limit to how much they can charge on their so-called surcharges. $40 for two and a half miles is crazy and I even got within 1 mile of my house by walking and it was still $38. There is no limit to how high they will go and their charges. Half their drivers don't even know where they're going. Some don't even speak English. This is the worst company I have ever seen and a lawsuit needs to be filed against them.

Like many others Uber charged me multiple cancellation fees that were driver's fault, not mine. Instead of refunding my Gift Card, they issue me Uber Credit. That credit has not been used for payment on the 30 trips I have made since it was sent to me. I have sent close to 100 messages to HELP and they assured me that if I added more money on my gift card it would be applied on next trip. 30 trips and $350 later, credit still there. After 45 days of constantly getting rides denied for insufficient funds, when my gift card/Uber credit amount that is combined together in payment was more than enough, I went to Houston Greenlight Hub. They too refuse to help me out and actually had security force me off the property. 
Only thing I got out of them is that Uber Credits cannot be used with gift card payment, only bank cards. So that means that HELP's messages assuring me that next gift card will work was BS. They told me I had to apply a valid bank card to use credits. I told them that I refuse to since they were hacked and customers information and money was stolen from their servers. The reply given by the MANAGER of the Hub was, ""I guess you don't want that credit then huh"".
These people don't care one bit about their paying customers and need to be exposed for the crap they pull. I'm sending emails to my local news station and paper with the details and support messages sent, in hopes that they will do a story on Uber. I hope that others will do the same. They will keep screwing us with bogus charges and refuse to correct them until someone stands up and let everyone else know how they do business. To me it's unfathomable how they don't have a customer service phone number to call. They pretty much put Yellow Cab out of business and took over the #1 spot, but no C Service to speak to? 
Almost seems like they don't care or know that if they did they might actually have to give the money they took back. Either way, I'm going to do all I can to inform as many people possible of their unwillingness to properly provide customers with any type of real contact information and refusal to reimburse those who they improperly charged. That's stealing in my eyes and they should get punished like anyone else would if they did the same.

Uber as a company does not care about consumers. First, there is no way to communicate or get support. Second, there is no consistency between the website and the app. What can be done in one cannot in the other and vice versa. Third, the app does not always do what it is told. For instance I wanted to pay with a credit card and it defaulted to another account even though I specifically chose the CC. Fourth, the app rates the rider but does not give feedback. How does a rider know what they did that offended the driver so they can correct it? Finally, the web page and the app are cumbersome. It is extremely ironic that a user has to verify. They are not a robot to access a utility run completely by computers."

To my knowledge Uber manipulates driver ratings in order to keep people at certain levels. They need so many people at a certain rating to keep numbers active.

Many people are thinking that Uber can help for earning some money. But it is totally wrong. Uber is already charging very low fare from customers and after all Uber is paying more low to the driver. Few days ago I made a call from Uber as a driver from Albany NY to JFK NY. Which is usually cost in regular taxi service about $350. In this payment the driver is paying for gas charges, toll charges, time duration, safe driving skill and etc. After dropping off to customer, driver must have to come back to his hometown as well. While coming back, the driver is not allowed to pick any passenger from JFK NY legally. After all the driver can save only $150. I got paid $153 only from Uber. And Uber charged $215 from customer. Which also very low. In this whole trip both side I put my life in risk and provided neat and safe ride with expert safe driving skill.
In this amount I paying my tax and many more travel expenses. And I save nothing after spending my whole day. I cannot drive in NYC area with Uber legally. It requires TLC NYC License for driving with Uber in NYC. I came back without having any passenger. This is totally unfair with any driver in Uber. I did not earn anything from this Uber ride. How Uber is calculating the fares, only Uber is making money, driver is not making anything. Driver can't save any penny on every ride. They are paying less than vehicle expenses. I. Which amount any driver cannot say that he/she had made good money. In any business an investor always charges for service a reasonable amount, in that amount investor is making his/her business expenses and profit. 
Then the investor can say happily that he/she had made something good. Uber expects with the driver to provide neat and clean vehicle with safe driving skill. Uber already charging very low fare from riders and paying more low to drivers. How the drivers can save and can maintain their vehicles. Uber is destroying the taxi fare market. This why many people are joining and leaving Uber daily. I am totally disappointed from Uber because of all this scene.

UBER charged me for trips on Dec. 29. 2017 to Dec. 31, 2017, but then the second driver for UBER overcharged me for the trips for the dates I have listed above and the first trip was to do an application for a apartment in Wood Village Apartments. Then after that I told him to go to the pharmacy to pick up my vitamins on Capital Street in Jackson MS, then after that I told that second driver to take me back to ** and the trips the second driver for UBER was supposed to take me to is for the particular dates I listed. He overcharged me $333.00 for all those trips and I ended up only having $35.00 left in my account and debit cash management card from Fidelity after the UBER driver took all of my money off my Fidelity debit card ending in **. 
I never got reimbursed for my $333.00 from UBER and I don't schedule transportation with these people anymore, because they lie and tell me they are going to give me transportation, but the drivers for UBER never give me any type of transportation requests, so I end up wasting my money and my time trying to get transportation from UBER.

UBER does not properly investigate passenger complaints. They just take the word of the passenger who can malign your character at will. Twice accused of being impaired, but do not do drugs or alcohol just misjudged a turn on a narrow street the first time and the second time have no clue what they thought I’d done and Uber doesn’t tell you. 
Another time I got blocked from driving was because I returned a phone that was forgotten in my car and the girl was crazy talking about her job and life and I was nice enough to listen and offered some advice. The final block and formal dismissal was that I offered my hand to hold an older lady out of the back seat of my car and was accused of sexual misconduct. That one is beyond nuts. They obviously don’t look at all the 100s of positive ratings and wonderful compliments. They only look at the false accusations. I guess I could accuse any driver of anything and make them unemployed in a snap. UBER needs a more reliable method of investigating complaints as their current method is possibly causing some unverifiable character assassinations. Not a very employee friendly company. Shows it is just about the MONEY for them. Would never advise anyone to drive for or use Uber!

It was the same time of day, approx 1:30-2 pm. I put in a complaint to Uber and their response was that there is a delay between the upfront price and the actual price charged. I asked why it would be that much more at the same time of day with no traffic from when we took Uber from airport. No response or offer to refund me the difference. No apologies.

Last week I ordered an Uber but I canceled it before it arrived and took the bus instead. When I got home I received an email from Uber saying that they had revised my charge. Apparently the driver filed a claim for something Uber called a ""cleaning fee"". I disputed this saying that I had not even entered the vehicle and asked for proof of this claim. They then sent me several photos which showed what appeared to be damage to a seat cushion from a cigarette burn.
Again, I disputed the fee. I was eventually able to get them to reverse the $80.00 fee but not without MULTIPLE emails back and forth. I have since sent them several emails asking what kind of consequences there would be for this driver and asking for a reply. None have been received so I guess that means that there are NO consequences for this dishonest, greedy driver. Terrible service. I will be closing my Uber account.

I've been taking Uber to work and back, while the car gets fixed. I have a few things I'm pissed about. First for one thing I had to go to work this morning and every time a driver accepted my ride, they would cancel on their way to pick me up, that happened 3 times. I didn't want to be late for work. One of the drivers suddenly texted me and said he can't do my ride and the idiot tells me to cancel. I got a charge for canceling. Then another idiot driver that accepted to give me a ride, he stopped driving. ( I saw him on the map) just sitting there a long time, he texted me finally and asked me if I would mind if he changes vehicles? I didn't answer him, so the weirdo canceled my ride. I'm very angry at this point, so I tried Lyft (which is much better) and I got a ride from them right away. I made it to work on time.
Later I checked my bank account and Uber charged me for a ride I didn't take. They took 19 dollars, another day they took $19.12 from my account on March 4th, when my daughter sent for the ride with her phone and paid for it! Don't use these crooks! I'm angry they stole money out of my bank account falsely! I heard on the radio they're being sued and I hope they get put out of business! Worst drivers ever! Use Lyft!

I have used UberRush multiple times to deliver flower arrangements from my floral shop. I had a problem in November of 2017 and in February of 2018. When you call the support number, it is routed out of the country always. With all due respect, often the person trying to help has a strong accent which can make it difficult to understand what they are saying as well as, often, the reason for my call is often lost in translation. WHY IS UBER UNWILLING TO PROVIDE HELP WITHIN THE UNITED STATES?
They instructed me to send an email to help Uber.com which I did both times. The email response that I received in both instances clearly was written by someone whose first language is not English, as the response had numerous grammatical errors and did not provide any sort of answer that made sense. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR UBERRUSH IS RIDICULOUS. I have to wonder why Uber allows this given the bad press they have been receiving as of late.
I just spent 30 minutes on the phone with RACEL who said she was putting through a credit for $70.11 for a delivery which was never delivered. The driver returned two hours later with the flowers claiming he could not find the address. I opened a new ticket and the woman who came for the same Delivery had NO PROBLEMS DELIVERING WHATSOEVER. To make matters worse, the first driver also charged femme for the return trip to my shop to bring back the flowers. I then received two emails saying I WAS NOT receiving a refund.

On Friday, February 23rd I requested a pick up from a doctor's office back to the office for a conference call. The Uber driver arrived (based on my phone tracking display) then canceled my ride (not sure why -- but can speculate that he saw my race and didn't want me in his vehicle. It took 10 minutes to get another Uber driver and I was late for my call.
On Monday, February 26th, I called for Uber at 12:25 to get to a 12:30 appointment (I was willing to be 5 minutes late). I immediately got a response and tracking indicated that my ride was 10 minutes away. Five minutes later tracking indicated my ride was 8 minutes away, five minutes after that tracking indicated my ride was 10 minutes away so I called the driver. He stated he was only 5 minutes away but tracking indicated he was 10 minutes away. 
I explained that I had an appointment that I was going to have to cancel if he wasn't there soon. He told me that he was sorry and that he thought someone else had picked up my request. I had to cancel my appointment. I received an email this morning that I was being charged almost $6.00 for another driver who came to pick me up. I had no knowledge that anyone else was on the way. Initially my experience with Uber was pleasant, timely and always cordial. The last two experiences are too much for me and I find that they are now unreliable. Goodbye Uber.

The company is worst in consumer affairs as it does not have a proper means of communication in case of any dispute/issue. The only option is to write your query in the help section of the app, but that also does not get solved. In my case, recently I was trying to book the ride but due to less balance in my payment, I was not been allowed to book it so I changed the payment method to Cash and booked the ride and paid the cash to the driver at the end of the trip. However, while trying to book subsequent ride, I noticed that the payment for earlier ride was o/s, for which I tried to find the Uber's Customer Care no. which I could not found anywhere so was forced to taken other modes for travelling for the subsequent rides and I put up my query in the Help Section.
But later I was replied that the ride was a non-cash ride, so they can not reverse the transaction. The customer care did not even bothered to contact me for understanding the problem or to the driver to find out whether the payment was done in cash or not. Though the amount involved is very small (Rs.42 only) and where I am a very regular customer who have taken far bigger trips in Uber, if they can not resolve the issue, I consider it as a very rude behavior on part of the company. And I lost my faith in the company and even if I pay that amount, I am not sure there will be no such problems in future which might involve bigger amount. Thus I have decided to discontinue using their services without even payment of that disputed amount (as it is I have already paid it in cash).

Lately I must question Uber's employment screening practices. For instance last Sunday on February 18th I used Uber to commute to work. I came downstairs 30 minutes early for a seven minute commute. I connected with first drive and that appeared to be 8 minutes out. When my Uber approached the 1 minute out mark the driver canceled with no notice. I was picked up again and I immediately call the Uber driver and was sent to voicemail 3 separate times. When my cell displayed 'arriving' the driver called and stated he was at the back gate. I explained to driver that I was at the front gate and I did not know the location of back gate. I also stated I attempted to call 3 times to inform him (""Chico"") that I was at front gate. His exact words were, ""Bye Girl"" and he immediately disconnected and canceled trip. Another driver picked me up and I arrived at work at exactly 11 pm. I got to work and immediately put in a complaint and nothing was done.
Fast forward to Sunday, February 25th... Again I am downstairs at 10:30 p.m. waiting for Uber driver. I call Rosoid who is driving a Kia Forte and attempt to direct him to my location because he states GPS is off. Rosoid reaches gate and I gave him gate code but he was unable to gain access due to incorrectly inputting code. Rosoid became frustrated and stated ""I cannot get in lady... have a nice night... I am leaving."" Fortunately I had walked out of side gate and was able to catch him before he left.
During the trip he constantly complained and stated I should look at things from the driver's point of view and I should not be frustrated. When I arrived at destination he stated have a good night and I stated the trip did not contribute to me having a good night. I exited vehicle and Rosoid instantly called me a **. I stated, ""Did you call me a **?"" and he said he was reciting music on radio (of he wasn't) and before he drove off he screamed out his window ""** get a ** car"". In short the days of nice Uber drivers has run its course. Bye Uber.

I drove Uber for some time as a part time. It is so disgusting. They deactivated my account for the reason that I was driving slow in heavy traffic and I was saying it a good weather when the rider does not like it. When they deactivated my account I did not feel good for some time because I began to play with it. You cannot make money but it was a fun. But don't do it. Consider some of the following issues: How do you deal with crash? How do you deal with your depreciation? You are actually making minimum wage. How do you deal when you are deactivated?

I drove for Uber in 2016 and had an accident. Uber's insurance is a low ball tactic, fraudulent, lying, scamming company. I noticed fraud in my accident and no one did nothing. All these false claims on the insurance papers. I later discovered it was done on purpose. Even the police report was a lie and never accepted. I contacted Uber and Farmers and they have done nothing. However, I see how their partnership in Pittsburgh works against the victim and engages in stalking, harassment and mail fraud. Til this day my mail is stolen or given away to these fraudsters and there was a breach but that's on a hush now. I still suffer from injuries and have no help. They target you and these people who are involved have greed. That's why it was done.
The insurance covered 10 vehicles per accident for 1.5 million so I can see where the greed and ignorance came from. I pray to God that each one is exposed for what they did up to the mayor. It's a shame as a woman that I've been treated so unfair and as a driver could of died in my accident. My car damage was estimated more then what it costs, my car was never looked at by past lawyers and police didn't investigate anything and that was on purpose. I'm struggling everyday due to the negligence of the accident drivers, police, doctors and the crooked lawyer I had which was Simon & Simon. Damn shame the corruption.

I was attempting to walk from my house to an Uber car that was waiting for me on December 27, 2017. I slipped on the ice (broke my hip) and couldn't get up. When the Uber driver unsuccessfully attempted to load me into the car, and determined I couldn't board, he tossed a water bottle to me (which I couldn't retrieve as I was completely immobilized), left me in the middle of the street, and drove off. Luckily a neighbor came momentarily and called 911, or I might have died of shock and exposure. 
My son (whose Uber account we used for this ride) contacted them, and after Uber's investigation, we didn't even receive an apology from Uber or the driver. I believe that drivers are not held accountable for poor practices such as leaving an injured passenger, as long as the company is not legally responsible for the accident. Though our lawyer has informed us that there is no legal recourse, I wish Uber riders to know that you can't count on being treated with the most basic human decency, which would include calling 911 and staying on the scene until help arrived.

He never arrived and charged for a trip that neither my mom or child was in the car! You can see in the email images that there is no way in hell that short of a trip could have been $18! My mom called Dial 7 and they took her and the baby home. This is outright fraud.
Uber does this ALL the time when anyone in my family requests carseats. Lately, and I have a 4.77 rating, the drivers have been lying about my pick up location and want me to meet them blocks away.

I was overcharged by Uber recently. I was shown a fare of 787.66 and at the at of the trip the fare was 1875 and I had to pay it. Later I contacted Uber and they said it happened due to GPS error and they refunded me the difference in Uber credits. Now, I don't understand who has given them the right to convert my money into Uber credits!!! I have no intention of using Uber again after this bad experience.
I contacted them many times and I provided them with my bank details and they told me they cannot refund my money to my bank account. So, they overcharged me and then they converted my money into Uber credits without my permission. Now, I have 1200+ Uber credits in my Uber account. I really don't want to use Uber again and I want my money back because that's my money and Uber has no right to decide it for me to how to use my money (as they have decided for me that I need to use that money for my next rides).
I request you all not to use Uber as they don't care about the customers. They steal your money and blame GPS. I am not the only one who was overcharged and treated like this. During my ride, someone called the driver and he was also arguing with the driver for the same issue. Uber has lost one customer for sure and I request everyone don't use their service.

Uber has very bad customer support. If their driver charge more they didn't refund any amount to customer and he has to pay more than double some time because of Uber bad system response or driver ask to pay more amount. In this way Uber is cheating its customer. They should ask their driver to pay back extra amount instead of blaming customer to pay through online methods. They simply says they didn't pay the cash payment that is paid by mistake."

Thank you (customer service rep). Yesterday Feb 14, 2018 I picked up three pool riders at the airport going to Seattle. I estimated in my head roughly $20 each, or a $60 payout to me. When the earnings finally loaded, I was given $35. I assumed it was for the longest of the three riders. No! It was the total I was being paid for all three riders!!! I checked what Uber collected and was equally shocked to find out you charged the riders, including discounts, a total of $96!!! You used my car to load up three different fares from the airport to Seattle. You charged the riders, and were paid $96 for my time and effort driving them. The only problem is, you only deemed it necessary to pay me one dollar for every three you collected from them. It IS highway robbery. You are robbing me (on the Highway) of my just portion of the fares you collect from the public for my time, effort and risk.
I have no issue with you taking 25% of the fares. That is what you need to run your business. I DO have an issue with you taking 65% of the fares that I earned for you, and giving me only 35%. I see there is clearly no remedy from your so called help department. I have sent in 5 requests and get the same tired pat answers every time. I think the next step for me has to be the news and publicity of your rampant disregard for the drivers who spend their time and risk their vehicles every day for you. When you feel it is OK to take 65% of our fares for yourself, something needs to change. I will wait for one last response from you. Hopefully not a trite repetition of the last 5 answers. Indignant in Seattle.

I have been an UBER rider for more than a year. Here in Richmond VA, United States. Never pay attention on charges of UBER 'cause I trusted the company and my account was healthy, good balance most of the time. I used UBER twice a day going to work. I got no car, sometimes exceptionally more than two times, but my usual is two. I start noticing that on my pending transaction of the bank I have instead of 2 charges, 4 charges... up to 6 charges on one day. So I decided NOT TO TRUST and check all my transactions and validated them with the receipts they send to the email when I then close the trip. I found more than 5 overcharges. 
When after so many struggles to get to them for HELP ('cause is the worst customer service access in the world) finally they told me about the ON HOLD issue with this exactly words: ""Authorization holds are not actual charges, it is just a ""hold"" that is placed on your account that you will see as ""pending"" or ""processing"" because it is not an actual charge to your account. Authorization holds are in place to secure payments when a ride is requested. It is placed on your account to ensure you have sufficient funds to cover your trip fare. I can also confirm that it will drop off or disappear from your bank statement after a few business days."" 
The bank withdraw the charge from my account as UBER charge me, then I found in two days trip, 4 charges or more. Absurd!!! UBER is not a HOTEL, you place a RIDE and you pay for it with your selected payment method that they should verify is valid since the moment you attached to your account. NOT on every trip. If you don't have balance you don't ride. That is it. DON'T OVERCHARGE ME. I don't want charges ON HOLD, less when I am a customer on daily basis for more than a year. You verify everything about me when I signed on. What in the world!!! This is so frustrating. The only this that is demonstrated in my case, is that I am a number in UBER, a number on 40 millions riders. But can you imagine how much money is ON HOLD CHARGES for 40 millions users for 24 hrs... is financially attractive numbers. Think about it. Very concern. Hope somebody track this on hold abuse. 
Improvements for UBER: well, 1) the app MUST be more transparent in the transactions and charges to the riders. 2) Definitively any ON HOLD charges, the UBER driver is validated on sign on and only review it if it change the payment method 3) charges for cancellations must be review too, most drivers are so irresponsible and never show up 4) UBER technology is not for everyone, old people have problems to be drivers 5) Please customer service is awful, create a chat or phone number, a case number. We who rides... WE ARE LIVING PEOPLE, check your charges everyday. you also can be harmed as me.

Please refund me the difference... thanks."" They wrote back: ""I reviewed your trip, and can see that the price you were charged $30.03 matches the price you were shown before you confirmed the trip. If there’s a significant delay between entering your location and confirming your trip, your price may sometimes change. If that's the case, we'll always ask you to re-confirm the new price."" 
I replied: ""No that is not the case. I would not have accepted the price at $30. We would have just driven. My initial price was $15.42, once I hit confirmed, it recomputed and said that price is no longer available and it gave us 16.46. But I was charged 30.03.

We ended up having to take a very long route back to my house due to her impatience. Being a nice person I didn't say anything. When I got out I checked the back seat which was stained and filthy, to make sure I didn't leave anything behind. No coke spill, nothing. We exchanged pleasantry. Nothing, ""oh you ruined my car!""

This is my second day with Uber as a driver. Already have issues... went to cash out my earnings of $138 and received a message that I don't have access. Call and was told you have to wait 1 week to receive earnings. Asked to speak with a Supervisor and was informed there is no such individual available because they don't have one. After insisting on either a supervisor or a team lead the customer representative still insisted there was no such person. Then after standing my ground remarkably he has a supervisor.
This lady gets on the phone and tells me there is a deadline to when you as a new Uber driver/account has to submit all documentation to prevent your account being locked out and/or inactive. Well now that it's active I have to wait 72 hours and 22 rides before I can request instant pay. Well I have the text when Uber notified me and I informed her of the date and time... well guess what!!! She tells me to double check my facts!?!? What do you mean double check, because when I asked her to provide she didn't have the time only the date but I gave the text message and have to double check. Then she changed it from 2/1/18 72 hours wait to starting on 2/3/18 72 hours wait.
Well now we are back to about a week wait for my money which she initially told me the her employee was wrong. So when I brought this point up she changed her story and went back to 72 hours from 2/1/2018 at 12:43 pm. Then in the next breath tells me to expect a longer wait time. I thanked her for all the inconsistencies/ lies... also thank her for keeping my money hostage which was to be used to towards paying essential bills!!!

UBER IS A HUGE SCAM, they quote you one price when you request the Uber and then they change the price after you request your ride, they basically double the original price that they quote to you first, this is a huge scam and if you don't check on time they can easily scam you by doubling the price that you never agreed to. I am not done with reporting Uber to every place I can because this is a rip off... I advise everyone to stick to regular taxi cab service."

On Jan 28th 2018. Car service cost $4.60. For me today to church pickup was CXL by driver so he will get $5.00. I’m standing in the middle of the street and he drives off while I’m speaking to him on the phone. I was dressed for church. This is the second time this occurred. I’m cancelling this service. I want a refund. Placing a stop payment on this transaction. Car ** Honda Accord. I was on the phone with him and he still left... Why???"

Well I have been driving for Uber for 1 week and if there is one thing I learnt is how cheap people really are. The worst invention in taxi service history has to be this Uber pool thing. Everyone and their mother picks Uber pool because it’s cheaper than Uber X but refuse to want to deal with other passengers in the Uber vehicle. So not only do I lose money with Uber pool but I get to deal with people that don’t comprehend what Uber pool is. 
Also I love Uber eats. Let me tell you the lack of parking in some locations are great. I have seen some Uber drivers just leave their car in the middle of the road out there with their hazards lights on and go into the store. First of all when I get a call with like 3 people in an Uber pool but they are just a big family is amazing because that leaves no other room for other passengers anyway. I mean I love how people are able to just cheat the system. Of course no other taxi company comes close to the highway robbery of Uber Pool because everyone loses. If there is one thing Uber should do to make more money is delete the pool option.

I don't mind riding Uber. The only issue I have with Uber is some of their policy. It happen a lot to me that my Uber driver cancel because they lost and can't found where I'm located at the moment. And Uber charge me for the driver cancellation. That's not my fault if they lost. And I have to pay for that. When they refund you they give you a credit to use for your next trip. Uber is funny so they never lose and we already lose. I'm not happy about that and want Uber to start refund in our card. Thank God the trip was only 4$. Imagine a trip of 30$ that a driver decide to cancel because they unable to find you. UBER CHANGE THAT POLICY OR I WON'T USE YOU ANYMORE."

THIS IS AN EXTREMELY URGENT MATTER AS I AM LOOKING TO FILE FORMAL LEGAL CHARGES ON UBER CORPORATION IN SAN FRANCISCO as their malice & lack of proper technology has caused me to lose approx. $700 income which I have screenshots as proof, but they made a mockery of me by ignoring my very emotional one hour visit, providing all of my proof, & they ever intended on helping me at all. The supervisor promised to get San Francisco headquarters involved which he never did as I never received any reimbursement to income loss or an explanation to why they are allowing this harassment to continue! I was given ""inside"" information on why this is happening to me only in the day shift and if it is true, Uber can be shut down for this!
Since they are refusing to remedy this, I now have no choice but to obtain legal assistance along with our local media troubleshooters to expose them for what they are. I WILL TAKE THIS ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT IF I HAVE TO AND UBER DOES NOT INTIMIDATE ME & they certainly do not need any more negative press, but to interfere with me trying to earn an honest living, out of malice & because of whistleblowing to other drivers, is not going to be tolerated any longer. Us drivers are also cheated out of surge amounts clearly offered to us when we accept the rides, but never paid to us correctly. I have hundreds of screenshots also showing this which I believe is also illegal and also sent to Uber via the ""support center"" who denies making the pay adjustments even with the proof that the surge was at a certain amount at the time of dispatch so they owe me for this also. 
Even though we are contractors we have to be paid what is being showed at that current time as the pay rate and we are not. It was when I stood up for us drivers with this accusation, when this daytime driving at the airport, staying #1 in the queue for up to 7.5 HOURS each day, being at the #1 spot in queue due to the hours I waited to get there, and being stuck in that spot with no rides given to me but all other drivers at double digit spots, would get all the rides and I had no choice but to leave each day of no income because of what torture they are putting me through on purpose. I made videos on what happened to me and I plan on releasing them to all social media and hopefully televised media troubleshooters. Us drivers sit in that inhumane holding lot with disgusting facilities (porta johns that are rarely cleaned and sanitized) for ONE REASON only. To receive rides from either Terminal A, B & C ONLY. 
We should not be given rides outside those 4 walls and I seem to be the only driver that gets them and of course I am not losing my spot in line to go do a $2 ride at the local mall but when they keep sending me those non-airport related rides, and I decline, they push me to the bottom of the queue which wasted all those hours or they shut my account off thinking I do not want to drive!!! This is a company worth BILLIONS and cannot get their technology dept. to fix these things? LYFT would NEVER dispatch any rides to any drivers in the Holding lot that does not relate to picking up travelers. I have so many hours spent in calling the outsourced helpline and you can pull up my calls to see I have begged them to get my calls to Corporate so they can look into these accusations I am making. 
At first I thought there were not enough morning and mid-day travelers UNTIL the Port Authority CONFIRMED EACH DAY I WAS PURPOSELY NOT SENT RIDES SO I CAN EARN A LIVING, in the hours I was not dispatched anything, there were over 40 planes landed and approx. 1700 travelers landing and I'm sure needed rides as every other driver was being dispatched but me. Being in the queue as the next driver to go out & not one ride was sent to me the first day for 7 hours (5 a.m.to noon), the 2nd day 5.5 hours (7 a.m.-12:30 a.m) and the 3rd day another 7 hours + and that is when I LOST MY COOL as I was now at over 30 hours of not being offered one airport ride resulting in no daytime INCOME!!! 
I recorded all the vehicles that left then let to pick up passengers though they arrived only 1/2 hour before being sent out!!! The video also has sound bites of me interviewing other drivers and their confirmations that they were only waiting short times, while I was there 7 hours, and they were on their 2-3 ride! The Hub sent me away with only $100 from the minimum $700 I was owed for the 3 days with no rides sent to me, and the promise Corporate will contact me and that was over 2 months ago & and I have NOT heard anything else regarding this VERY SERIOUS matter denying me of the right to work. Something you may find very interesting is the night following the 2nd daytime of another 7 hours not receiving rides, I was working a concert at Prudential Center and I met a driver in a Black SUV & he laughed and said he knew EXACTLY what was happening. 
He was an EX-UBER back office employee and told me of an ""inside"" way to get back at drivers who complain and ""piss them off"". He said it is called ""FLAGGING"". Any driver that gets on their bad side, is given a small black arrow next to their account and a certain algorithm code is made to the flagged account that causes the computer to cease all dispatches to this driver once they hit #1 in the queue but again, this only happens to me any day, from morning until evening so I must have made somebody on the day shift upset but this also must be not permitted. I am done with this discrimination for whistleblowing & speaking my mind and IT HAS GOT TO STOP!!! The Hub which is now in Secaucus tell us drivers whatever they have to get us out of their office. 
It was SWORN to me by the Supervisor at the Hoboken Hub, he would personally ensure all of my screenshots and numerous complaints about these disgusting tactics making me lose hundreds in income, would be handled so I am sure you understand my frustration. If you are able to read the messages sent to me by hundreds of passengers who take time out of their day to send them, you will see I am a very highly regarding driver and one of the best. 95% of my passengers ask if I can give them my cell # and become their permanent driver for cash and I politely turn them down because I feel that is stealing from the Company, something I will never do. They love how friendly and funny I am and offer snacks and water to everybody. 
The comments are the ONLY reason I still drive for Uber especially since they know that their fee starts at 50% and goes to 70% from the rider's fare and give us the measly leftovers meanwhile WE DO ALL THE WORK!!! This is immoral, disgraceful, & a business practice that should be investigated. Most driver's had no idea they now keep that much for themselves and I made sure they all know it not and Uber did not like that. Oh Well!! We signed a contract to pay them a fee of 25%, nothing more. I now make approx. $50 - $70/night compared to the $200 per night I was earning when the fee was what I contracted for. It is ALL A SCAM. I am only asking for reimbursement for the proof I provided them showing how many hours went by with me sitting for 1/2 a day looking like a fool while every other driver was making tons of $. I am at poverty level because of them. 
I know that 75% of the drivers take cash for rides every night and make thousands a week in cash and they have showed me proof of this. Since I wanted to see if Corporate or the Hub fixed this problem with me and today was the 1st time I decided to drive the airport during the day and sure as anything, THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME AND AFTER 5.5 hours there with no rides being sent my way, I went home. I could have driven rush hour and made good money but I should not be singled out not being able to do daytime airport rides. I was #1 in the queue again for hours. As a legal US Citizen, I have the right to earn income and to have no interference with this. I AM TIRED OF THEIR LIES, THEIR DECEIT, THEIR FRAUDULENT business practices towards me! I am praying I can get some assistance with this matter as it is emotionally, financially and physically impacting my life negatively.

In July of 2017 I used Uber Pool to go 1.5 miles from the Atlanta airport to my offices near the airport. I was quoted $5 to $7 dollars before I accepted. (I used Google Maps to book it, which Uber allows. If Google was the problem, which no one at Uber ever said, their problem should be with Google.) I got charged over $13. I wrote Uber and in their response they emphasized that what I am quoted before the trip will always be the price, ""no surprises,"" then went on to say they had reviewed the trip, and the charge was in line with what it should have cost, so ""you're good.""
I went back and forth with what appeared to be a chatbot which was unresponsive to any of my arguments. I checked the same route and never got quoted higher than $5 to $7. I checked with colleagues who had done that route and they never paid that much. But I could not get resolution. Ultimately I disputed all but $6 with my credit card company. The next time I tried to use Uber, they wouldn't let me until I paid the full 13.26 even though I only disputed 7 of it. I've opened up new cases on this, and I get the same word for word non-sequitur responses. I haven't used them since July only because I refuse to pay that charge, and they have lost a lot of business. I would like to use Uber again especially in other countries (where I can't use Lyft). But is there no way to talk to a real person who can see how stupid this is?

I think it's very inconsiderate and inappropriate that you corporate people do not address the issue that your drivers have with this so called support team. I have been screwed over so many times this week by your support. We are pushed against a wall and there is nothing we can do but accept whatever resolution your so called specialist come up with. Which is so unacceptable. We send yall a grievance or an issue and yall refer it right back to the same people who did nothing to solve the problem only made it worse. My account keeps getting locked so I can't get my instant pay every... Every month. Why... I have my phone which the app is on my phone and you have to use my phone to get in my account to swipe my instant pay... Smh.
Next I order a go card. I received it on the 20 of Jan. I activated it. An instant pay still went to the wrong account. Why? Because no one told me to switch my account on the partners app... Oh and then I did that. Called again the next day. Uber says everything is fine. ""Your instant pay will be posted to your go card..."" Lies once again. ""Oh I'm sorry it takes 2 days for the card to become active..."" That was not in the paperwork the go card came in. Uber did not tell me that the 3 previous times I called trying to fix this problem.
Next had an issue with a rider whose child wrote on my seat with permanent marker. They want to give me $40 for a cleaning fee... On cloth black seats. What was I suppose to do with that. Sad. So I get it cleaned cost $170.00. Give them the receipt and they say an inconvenience fee will be posted to my account in 24 to 48 hours... So to make sure it is going to the go card once again my 4th or 5th time talking to them. The man informs, ""Yes it's going to your card. Put the go card routing and accounting number."" I did this while I was on the phone with the man (Uber rep). And asked him why they didnt tell me about this before to change the account info. He was baffled. I asked him again was my 180.00 going to the go card... ""Yes. Yes it is..."" Once again lies.
It goes to the old account and nobody can stop a deposit. You're are a big company. Little business put stop pays on checks and deposits. So really. This is Uber's reply when I called at 530 in the morning. There is nothing that they can do. Huh. But yall have Fed me these lies and misinformed me about processes and procedures this whole week and my money is lost and I can't get it back. Wow. What kind of company is this... That do their driver any kind of way and treat them like they are nothing.
So it's 746 pm... I just got off the phone with them at 630 the same morning. And now my instant pay is locked up. Why. Who knows. It's some kind of flags on the account that no one can explain. We are not represented well enough. Wow. Once again... Uber wants us as driver to be on top of our game. Clean car. Dressed nice. Acting professional... But we cannot get any of these traits from you ay Uber. My customers love me and I adore my customers. I have done 850 trips since July 2017. I have put anywhere between 50 to 75 hours a week... 4.88 rating. I dont remember how many badges and compliments. And this is how we get treated. Oh wow.
But I know I won't get an answer. Yall executives dont care about the people who keep your company running. Yall treat us so bad... Wow. You will send this email back to your support team who barely speaks fluent and comprehensible English and they will mess up something else. The ones you have to tell, ""Excuse me I can barely understand you..."" The ones who does not know all the information that they need to know to help resolve problems. The ones who tell you half truths just to avoid confrontations about issue that we know should not proceed in certain manners. Wow... This is such a tragedy. Sad. Really sad.

On or about the middle of December I purchased a $50 gift card as an Xmas gift. It took Uber almost 3 weeks to send it to him. He did not get it by Xmas, but I overlooked it. He does not have a car so uses Uber often. I live very far from him and he did not know how to add the card to his app so had to wait till 1/22 for me to go visit him. Upon trying to put a code that is required in order to add funds to his account, I peeled off the code and the code was unreadable. After numerous phone call to Uber’s customers service number which brings you through a 3 question on winning a trip to Florida, Bahamas etc. which was a total waste of my time the person tells me I need to purchase another card and then they will refund my money. I am so far already out $50 I will not give them another $50 of my money. I am very frustrated and out $50. Buyer beware just give a Visa card and don’t purchase an Uber card. This is horrible."

I am being charge for a fare with Uber that is not mine. They keep telling me that a payment method that I used is associated with another account, so therefore the fare that has not been paid is mine. Then when I asked them to do research, they sent me an email that said for me to log back in using my email address. When I did that, they completely removed my account and gave me the account that was associated with the fare that had not been paid. When I told them that this was not my account. They emailed back and said it was and that the fare was consistent with other fares on my account. I told them this is incorrect. The account that was mine, I had used mine as early as 12/14/2017. This account was had not been active since 3/25/17. They refuse to remove this account from under my name.
Also, my account I have no idea what happened to my account with my bank information on the account. Then they tell me they cannot provide me this information because of legal issues. They keep trying to send this charge to my bank for collection. After I consistently told them do not try to access my account for this fee of $69.69. Then they went even further, they told me there is another outstanding fare that is associated with my payment method that is outstanding. They have restricted my Uber account until I pay these outstanding fares. This is unbelievable that I have to go through this, and that there is not a smart enough person that works there that undo this mess. A single payment method should not be the defining source to identify an account.

Uber failed me as a customer! I was scammed out of a cleaning fee when the driver submitted a fraudulent claim against me. Uber says they have measures in place to catch false and fraudulent claims. That turned out to be a big fat lie! They never ONCE researched the validity of the picture submitted. Instead, I was accused and told ""no response needed"" at every turn. 
It took me 5 minutes to do a reverse image Google search and found the SAME picture a Los Angeles Uber driver posted on his Twitter in 2015 of an incident that occurred. They did absolutely nothing to protect me as the customer and could care less as I keep getting generic emails. Now that I have sent them the proof I will be refunded in 5 business days.

I called an Uber ride. I called in plenty of time to make my bus which was not scheduled to leave until 9:40 AM! Since the ride was initially accepted at 8:50 or so, I had plenty of time to make it to 1727 Bedford Ave in Brooklyn, NY. But, Jorge CANCELLED the trip unbeknownst to me! After he called me on my phone to tell me he was in front of FedEx, which by the way, shares a building with the hotel from which I called him! I was staying in the NU Hotel on Smith St around the corner, less than 100 feet from where I was in the lobby at 85 Smith St. 
He was sent to 86 Boerum Place, in my opinion, erroneously by Uber. When he called on my phone, I simply asked him to drive around the corner to pick me up. I had luggage. He then cancelled the trip and then I needed to call for another driver. The second driver was very nice but could not arrive until about 9:18 AM and it took at least 20 min to get to Bedford Ave. So I missed the bus that I was scheduled on and which I had already bought a seat.
I then had Manson, the other Uber driver that I was forced to call, drop me off on Flatbush Ave in front of the Barclay Center and then I took the subway to Penn Station in Manhattan so that I could then book an Amtrak back to DC so that I would not be charged even more for parking! When I insisted that one of their (Uber's) 'higher ups' look at my case, they (Uber, specifically Swatis) responded as such: ""Please know that your concerns have been heard and actioned appropriately internally. With that, we will consider this matter resolved."" I have had other issues/problems with Uber in the past but let them go unreported. But this was not in anyway my fault and I insist that I receive some remuneration. It WAS NOT AN ""EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE!!""

I have been a driver for a number of years with Uber. They are big time crooks! Customers will show the driver the fares they are being charged (ex. $50) and Uber only pays the driver $11.95. The cut is supposed to be 80% driver and 20% Uber. They are big time liars and cheaters!! The so called 24/7 support line is also a Big Joke! It is outsourced to India and there is a serious language barrier. They never have a Supervisor available, however one will call you back. It never happens! They will deactivate your account in a heartbeat once you figure out their crooked and deceitful system of Lies and call them out on it! They can access all of your personal information through your Android, make it disappear, and blackout your phone with their technology.
When they want to deactivate your account, they will attempt to look at your driving record and hold traffic incidents against you that happened while you were on your own personal time. Why Uber? You are not my Employer and I am not your Employee. This technology company also routes calls to drivers of their choice. Ex. surge/higher rate calls are sent to specific drivers to advance their pay quickly! I thought calls were routed electronically to the closest driver? So much for a fair competitive market. This company that claims to not be a company but behaves like a company is a Big Joke! This is why there is an ongoing Federal Investigation.

Yup. So Uber claimed that a 24 hour McDonald's was open. Ordered 30$ worth of food. They said after 30 minutes they couldn’t find a driver and canceled my order. I called back and made sure Drivers were available. They said they were. I placed the same order again. $30. Half hour later turned out that McDonald's wasn’t 24 hours and they canceled the order again. Found out that McDonald's doesn’t open until 5. Ok fine. Waited until 5 and placed a new $30 order. After half an hour again they had no drivers and canceled my order. Waited until 6am when village inn was open. Called to make sure a driver was available. Ordered another $30 in food. Again. A driver was not available. I called again to complain. 
Uber apologized and said they would give me 50% off my next order. I thought that was fair and repeated the $30 order to Village inn. Thinking I’d pay $15. Nope. Would be the whole $30 and then they would refund me the $15 in three to five business days. I cancelled. Checked out my account this morning. Every single one of those orders went through even though they cancelled them and I never got any food. $200 out of my bank account.

I wanted to finally write a review regarding obtaining help from Uber as a driver. This company absolutely sucks when a driver needs help with the app. I was driving with no issues for 4 weeks and then was placed as “waitlisted” for no reason at all as my record is spotless.

Neither I, nor my friend had used Uber before but had heard their drivers were friendly from a friend of mine. On New Year's Eve of this year (2018) we (my friend and I) first used them to take us a couple miles from where we were to a club and it cost us $10, not including the tip. This was around 9:30 p.m. The driver was polite and was there within minutes of us ordering it. No problem. At the end of our night then, around 1:15 a.m. we called again to have them take us home. Now my house is roughly 10 min from the club so however any miles that is, I don't know, but when we ordered the Uber from the club the amount came to a little over $47. YES, I said over $47! And that was just to get ME home, without tip, and not even getting my girlfriend home! 
Well, obviously we thought it was wrong and got it (we didn't have a choice anyway, it was that, or drive drunk) and when the driver got there, the amount was correct!!! She said it was due to ""high call volumes."" So you mean to tell me that when they do good business and are busy, the customer gets punished? Shouldn't it be the other way around?! Pretty much what it was, they KNEW they had people over-a-barrel being as it was New Years and they took advantage. Either get them and pay, or risk driving and get a D.U.I. That was the really messed up part. And then the driver told us that the drivers don't even get any of the extra money, the corp gets it all!!! SERIOUSLY! Needless to say, I will NEVER be using Uber again.

My experience with drivers is good in general. My issue is with Uber as a company. I won a certain number of rides with Uber ($25 off of a number of rides). I was able to use it up to a certain point. All of a sudden, Uber posted a different promotion on my account. This prevented me from using my original promotion (the way it works the last promo added is used first). I complained and after days and days of going back and forth with emails, I was able to use my promo again. Then, suddenly they changed the expiration date of the promotion. Now it expired on 1/2/18 instead of 4/30/18 as originally stated.
I had 14 rides left. So, they did this on purpose so I don't use the 14 rides. Why give someone this promotion if you are not going to let them use it? I will make sure that this is out there in public for everyone to know. Also, I would rather contact someone at Uber directly, but being that they don't have customer service that can help, I will have to post this everywhere until I get someone to respond. I am not holding my breath though. I will also contact the company that did this promotion for Uber along with Sterling Vineyards who was one of the sponsors as well.

Uber’s rules to ride are very unfair to consumers. Today, we got a Uber to take us to Fairfax, 30 minutes from Arlington. When the guy arrived, not only was his car visibly dirty, old and making loud noises, when we got in it smelled like my grandfather who owned and worked on a farm with pigs, when he use to come home at the end of the day. Yet, we had very little choice but ride — unless, as in the past, we refused and get charged $24 anyway. Which brings me to my next issue with Uber — there have been times we’ve ordered a car, got downstairs in the time it would take, and the car is gone! We get charged anyway. Unfair and ridiculous. 
My son generally requests our ride and you wouldn’t believe how many times we’ve had to write for refunds because they take money we did not authorize. Most times they give you a very hard time and you can’t reach them easily; the other times you just plain don’t get your money back. This is bull. There should be a class action lawsuit brought against this company. People shouldn’t be forced to ride in dirty and stinking cars just because they can’t afford to lose their money and still have to call someone else to drive them (and that car may be just as bad). I’d like to know what I can do personally to advocate more regulation... write my Congressman? Thank you for your assistance!

**. That is the driver contact number who has no patience for his customers. My son ordered Uber, and the time he received his message, he went out but the driver had left by then... and ignored his calls, leaving him in a road that barely has any car passing from there. Then he finally replied and told him that he waited for so long... Seriously!! Isn’t there a charge for this time? The surprise is, when I called him to ask him to go back, he refused, and the second surprise is that my son had to pay for the car that was cancelled by Uber not by him... Great service."

After driving for 2 weeks for Uber, I was expecting the $300 bonus that was promised after 50 rides. However, when I called, they said that since I made more than that, I’m not eligible for it. I was very mad and expected to receive the bonus in addition to whatever I made. However, they scammed me from the bonus as well as other drivers. DO NOT work or ride for them.

I could not find a place to get help. Then I get an email saying that my insurance expires on December the 26th. When I finally get someone online I tell them I sent them 2 Insurance cards.

I received a promo code from an event I was attending for $10 off the Uber, but instead the app would only apply the pre-existing 40% off the next 10 ride promo that was already activated previously in the app. I contacted customer support through the app to rectify and refund the difference of $5.13. Each time they replied with a scripted email that stated the last promo code added is the first to be applied and they cannot switch the order they are applied. First, their statement was incorrect because the app did not work as they explained and when I stated this they sent the same scripted response to me. This is deceptive practices and their refusal to fix over $5.13 is ridiculous."

I recently had two incidents that shaped my many reason not to spend any more money with Uber. In New York, Uber is more popular among the natives than taking a train. Which is great, when dealing with the harsh winter. The issue is the service coming from the Uber drivers and Uber's customer service. Most recently I took a Uber ride to Far Rockaway, NY to Queens, NY which was a $50 dollar Uber pool. The car was very cold and in the beginning the Uber driver was very quiet. Once we got closer the destination the Uber driver began to get confused on what route to take. As I asked to make a right at the next light he turned around while driving and began to yell at me. We were on a parkway in Far Rockaway with cars driving all around us. He began to shout and hits brake twice jerking me from out of the seat. He begins to curse me out and tell me to shut up until we get there or he will make walk. 
Uber refunded the money the next day. A week ago I took an Uber pool to Home Depot. I was only suppose to be charge around $9 dollars for the fare. The Uber car smelled like cigarettes and to cover it up the Uber driver rowed his window completely down on the way to get rid of the smell. Mind you, it's December and it was only 40 degrees outside. The Uber driver received two pickup request and denied both and Uber charged me for a full ride. When I reached out to them they said I still have to pay a full price based of the distance because he didn't pick anyone else up. I can no longer use their service.

I am an Uber driver and have been doing it for the past year. Anyone who surpasses 25 Uber requests can cash out the same day, which is called Instant Pay. Lately I have been trying to cash out after working for them, and it doesn't give me an option. I spoke with 2 different supervisors with whom they tell me there is a lot of deliveries paid for through Uber Promotions and caused a red flag on my account preventing me from cashing out money I have earned. The first supervisor advised me to try taking a few rides instead of deliveries, and that should fix the issue and my money will be available the next day. I followed his advice and the next day I was able to cash out. 
Now a few days later, I get another flag on my account preventing me from cashing out. I called and spoke with Kim, an unhelpful supervisor, who is telling me that I need to do more rides to even out the promotion requests and can't tell me how many request I actually have to do. All they are telling me is I need to work more and do more request to cash out. I am already eligible for Instant Pay and should not be having this problem. The supervisor's only answer is I have too many promotion request and have to do more rides without promotions to cash out. She can't answer my question which is how in the world am I suppose to help that someone uses a promotion for their delivery or ride request? 
I am doing Uber in multiple areas and cities and I have no clue if someone is using some type of promotion to pay for their food delivery or ride request. If someone does that, why should that affect the Uber driver? How is that my fault people are using promos for their trips? That is unfair to me as an employee that I am not able to get my money that I earned because you decide to have promotions for riders or deliveries! You should not have promos then any longer. Also how in the world am I suppose to know someone used a promotion when accepting a request to make sure I take more request without promos to even it out to get paid same day as the supervisor said to do? She is telling me I can see if it's a promotion ride when I accept it, but there is nothing showing it's a promo for the drivers at all while doing a request! 
I asked if I could speak to another supervisor and the lady Kim said other supervisors would tell me the same thing and there was no one else to speak to. I asked maybe 10 times to please speak to another supervisor who can take this issue off my account and she continued to repeat herself each time and would not let me speak to someone else. I find it hard to believe a HUGE company like Uber, only has 1 supervisor available. I do not feel these employees know what they are doing. Over the last week I spoke to at least 5 employees and they all gave me different answers about my account. None of the employees I spoke to including supervisors, spoke English well. They all have trouble understanding anything that you say. I have never experienced so much horrible customer service in my life. I am going to look into switching to Lyft to drive. 
I have a friend who does deliveries only for Uber like I was trying to do occasionally like I do and she states she does not have this issue. I have driven for Uber for a year now and have never had this issue until the past 2 weeks. If I am working and making money, I should be able to receive my pay as does anyone else who is eligible for Instant Pay. If Uber wants to keep drivers' money and not pay them out same day because the driver is receiving too many promotion request, then Uber shouldn't allow promotions any longer, or you should give the driver the option to not receive those type of request if it will make you look bad for doing them and not get paid same day because of it. 
It's Christmas time and I should be able to do this on the side and cash out when needed so I can use the money for Xmas like I wanted to do, but instead I'm being treated like nothing all because Uber wants me to work a lot more rides for them in order to even out their promo rides they give me, just to pay me. Uber you are a scam and it's not right to penalize your employees for your own promotions you are giving to riders.

Decided to give Uber a try so loaded their app. My first ""trip"" was to return home after dropping my car off at dealer. Evening before I spent 20 minutes setting up my account and unsuccessfully setting my first trip. The next morning it took another frustrating 15 minutes to make the app understand that I wasn't traveling FROM home but TO home. Such an easy and logical event but the idiot app designers at Uber can't see that as an option. I finally left home with anticipation of using Uber for the first time. At the dealer I waited for 45 minutes for an Uber ride that never showed.

TLDR: Uber driver made stop for me, left with my stuff, charged me more and more, never came back and cancelled my trip after 10 minutes. -To Start: DO NOT EVER ADD STOPS. I have used Uber all over the world and asked drivers to make stops many times. This week was the last time. Story: Seattle WA USA. I had a great dinner after shopping and was in downtown Seattle. I requested an UBER, waited for the driver, who had a hard time finding the location I was at, although very easy to find. After he picked me up I asked him to stop by a store so I could grab some water before arriving at my destination. He agreed.
We found a store, he parked in front, and I told him, ""Wait here. It will take me 2 minutes."" He said, ""There may be traffic and I have to go around the block."" I said, ""Sure, just be sure to meet me right here."" He agreed. I ran in, came out 1 minute later and he wasn't there. I opened the APP, looked to see his location and it seemed he was circling the block. Suddenly he made a strange turn and started driving away from me. I tried to call, no answer, message, no answer, he then ended my trip after racking up the charges.
Worst part?? No one in UBER can ever help me. I have talked to roughly 10 people all who don't read history and repeat things. They said ""they will restrict his driving"" until my items are returned. They then said the items were returned to their office. I asked for photographic evidence, none provided and a sudden email stating that they aren't responsible for items left in a car after a trip ends!!! I was left! Abandoned then he racked up charges and stole my stuff.
I am waiting on them to reply to my latest messages, and if unsuccessful will end up hiring a lawyer which will cost more than me just buying what I lost. I hate UBER now after years of using them. I will never use them again unless my company pays and I will never trust them again. Sure maybe I should have kept my items in my hand, but I have never been deceived and robbed like this in my life.

Several hours later I explained I have proof and they finally agreed to refund a portion. No discount or future pass. No personal customer service.

Most drivers refused to come into my condo complex because the GPS shows my address as in the middle of the road. If I pin the address as suggested on their website they go to the wrong address and then cancel the trip. I regularly get double charged and have to request a refund. Also I have been noticing that in the last few weeks I have be quoted a rate, charge the rate, then refunded that rate, and charged a higher rate every trip. The saddest part of all is that in Edmonton Uber is the safest way to travel outside of the bus. I wouldn't get into a cab in this city ever and now I don't ever want to get into an Uber. I have contact Uber about my issues as well and been threatened multiple times. Uber is all about $$. They could care less about their customers."

I am sad and angry, I have bad experience with Uber before but this time has been the worse! I left my Quinny Buzz Xtra on the Uber last Sunday and I called several times to the driver but he never answer any of my calls, two days after he finally text me back about the items left on the vehicle and he told me that he is not the owner of the car, that he gave it back to the owner on Monday at 6 pm. That my stroller was probably there, so I request to call the owner of the car in that case and he said he didn't have a number to reach the guy. 
So to this I take action saying that I was going to track the plate # so I could contact him. Next this driver (Cristian) send me a pic with a number telling me that he believe that was the contact info for Gustavo, owner of the car. So I called, no answer, send messages, and let know Cristian that I couldn't reach Gustavo... Then he says that Gus was working, long story short, Gustavo owner of the car used for Uber called me and I explain the situation. To this he says that he had to call the police on Cristian because he wouldn't answer calls, messages or nothing and he wasn't paying his commission for using the car to work... ok! So Uber support just keep saying relax, “I am sorry we can't do anything because they are contractors.” Really?! So Cristian stole my stroller ($500) and it's all good. I should sit down and be happy about it. Now I got to buy a new one. This is really disappointed. #ubercostarica#

Multiple times I have asked for support from Uber and I get nonsensical responses from the non-existent response team. It is beyond frustrating. Aside from not having any customer service team, they have no address. I have tried countless ways to research a physical address with phone numbers but there are none. I do not know how a company can operate like this. Have plenty of resources for their drivers, but none for their customers."

Out of desperation, I signed up for Uber for an appointment. Registration was easy, and the app kept me informed about the time of arrival, which was FAST. A driver happened to be in my area and came right away. I was texted a photo and his ID by Uber, so I was reassured - but I did forward it to a family member as a security precaution. The driver was SO kind - congenial and eager to please. It was such a great introduction to Uber and I have been happy ever since."

I had just completed running the New York Marathon and had requested an Uber Pool ride back to my hotel. First, let me tell you what started out right: The driver agreed to the pick up and drop off locations via the app. I then called and spoke with the driver to let him know that the pick up location was actually blocked off due to the marathon, and we agreed on another pickup location 1 block away before the race road block. Before I was picked up, I got a notification that another rider would be joining for part of my ride. I was picked up by the driver at the spoken agreed upon location; shortly the 2nd passenger was picked up and dropped off. Now here is where it all went wrong: Moments after continuing to my destination, I got a notification via the app on my phone that my ride had ended.
I asked my driver what was going and he claimed, ""Gee I don't, I have another passenger to pick up now and your ride is over so you need to get out now"". Still confused, I asked him again how my could be over when we were still far from my agreed upon destination? This time he clearly played dumb, saying over and over again that he doesn't understand how is Uber app works, and I had to get out. In the middle of the street, by myself, in a strange location that was not even anywhere on my route.
Not wanting to argue, as it was clear that he had a new ride request for another that would clearly be more lucrative for him, and myself not wanting to continue the ride with this jerk, I peacefully exited the car where I stood in front of a private residence mid-town, shivering cold in the 50 degree, rainy weather, in the dark, having just completed running the 26.2 mile marathon and wanting nothing more than a safe ride back to the hotel to seek much needed rest, warmth and safety. No sooner than I exited the car, the driver was already scrawling his new fare's name of a piece of paper and standing outside his car, in the street, to meet his new fare, not once even having inkling of conscientiousness for what he had just done to me. And the driver still had the nerve to charge me $10 partial fare!!
Not excited to be using the Uber app again, but not on a street where any taxis were coming by and not having another other apps installed (such as Lyft), I requested a new ride. I was connected shortly with another driver that was 10 minutes away. 10 minutes is not an very long amount of time, if you are warm and safe, but again, dressed in running clothes, weary, and expecting to be a in safe warm car, I was stranded on the street to pace, alone, to wait for this driver. Also, this being not on a main street, and traffic very heavy due to the marathon rode closures, the 10 minute wait for him to be able to get to me was realistic. To my eternal happiness, he arrived within 5 minutes, and delivered me safely and nicely to my hotel.
The next day, finding the only way to file a complaint to Uber was via the app. I sent my complaint and within a couple hours was replied to with a wet blanket apology for the ""inconvenience"" and offered me a $5 credit of the $10 I was charged. To make this even worse, Uber credited the $5 towards another driver, one we had taken the day before!! I wrote back to have this corrected, to not harm the previous day's good driver's reputation or take from his well earned pay, and to preserve my good relationships with all the other good Uber drivers I have rode with.
Uber then wrote back with a full credit of my $10 (better, but certainly not enough to make up for the dangerous situation this driver put me in), and no mention of any discipline for this driver. I told Uber I would never use them again and would use Lyft from now on. Although all my many, many Uber experiences over the past few years that I have had have been 5-star, this one bad apple ruined Uber forever with me.

My appointment time for auto repairs required a drop-off early am for it to be there and available for a mechanic to begin the work. The Uber app was easily installed on my mobile device and was followed with the required information being filled onto the blanks. When typing a phone number, it gave an order to check SMS texts for a confirmation code to be used along with the number. No text sent with first try at 7:30 am. More tries, no texts and had to give up. Four hours later the texts with codes were sent at 11:08 am. Two attempts were unsuccessful at emailing Uber headquarters in San Francisco that included a few lively suggestions. As follows; I suggest someone there unclog your ride summoning impacted website rectum by swallowing an online laxative, followed by a readily available Fleets enema from a pharmacy.
I now must wait 1 1/2 weeks to have repairs done from being a no-show at the shop. That means safety concerns to drive as is. When using Uber once 9 months past, things went far better and a problem cleared up pronto by an apologetic and most courteous driver. What a letdown on this go round. If the world's greatest ability is dependability, why then are public service companies not aware of and learning such an important aspect of the business world? 
This incident is a second of its kind with the same problem and still no fix. Then, unlike now, I had made contact with their home base, only to be treated rudely and with great disrespect. Perhaps a reply is better not forthcoming after all. I at least have a choice of 4 codes and might need one to request service 12 hours ahead of when it is needed. Uber folks, you had oughta uncrimp the do-do contained in the app from the Google store.

Whether I am using Uber for a ride service or Uber Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Uber Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I guess moral of the story is this company makes the consumer pay for their employees mistakes. Please refrain from using this service if possible, I know I'll be finding alternatives."

Why is it so hard for you to understand that if I am trying to retrieve Uber cab, with the same email just a different phone number that it is me? If you say it is for security and you don’t recognize the phone number, then your security system is **. Because therefore if it was any good, your security system would link my original number to my new number which is under the same account and recognize that it is me. So stop rejecting my new number. What do you think I want everyone calling me on my private or personal number. Do not respond to this until you have fixed your problems. Or IT will only tell ""you people"" TO SHUT THE ** UP.

I use Uber fairly frequently. Overall it has been a good service. I’ve had amazing drivers. You cannot call them. Only go through some steps to send them messages. I want to just call them if I have an issue. It’s so frustrating. However, two things have happened in a short time that will make me be very wary in using Uber in the future. Might just go back to taking cabs.
The first didn’t leave us feeling good about Uber but we let it go. My brother called an Uber to pick us up from the beach. The Uber driver arrived with an Uber and Lyft sign in his window. We didn’t get a good feeling about him from the outset. He dropped us off at our home as arranged. He accepted a cash tip (this was before you could tip on the Uber App.) Later Uber retroactively charged my brothers card for $50.00 because the driver reported we had gotten sand on his floor mats. He picked us up at the beach... My brother contacted Uber and said that even though it was ridiculous in the first place, the $50.00 charge was not in line with their own criteria on their website. They refused to refund anything. Period.
Now today, I see an email from Uber in my inbox. ""You rode with Dario 4.17 miles. Trip Time 00:12:04 Car UberX,"" with the following message: ""Adjustment Care due to different drop off locations. Ricardo (whoever that is), Previous charge: $25.35. Charged Personal **: $233.58. New Total: $258.93."" Plus I thought the driver was good and am a generous tipper in general so I also gave him a $10 tip through Uber.

                        
                    
                        
                            We did not and I again 100% state we did not change any stops routes or anything of the sort period! I just checked my bank account and sure enough for one 4.17 mile ride which lasted about 12 min. I had the three deductions, one for $25.35, one for $10.00 and one for $233.58, all withdrawn from my bank account.
That is the most expensive 4 mile ride I have and will ever have taken. You can’t speak to a human and I get no email confirmation that my dispute has even been received. I have heard zero back. This is beyond horrifying. After now writing this I’m even more upset...

Last night I returned home from the airport using Uber. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's ""dynamic pricing"" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.
The algorithms used by Uber are suspect. I live in a City that has contracted with Uber to provide local transportation free of charge...using a City vehicle. It took me 40 minutes to arrive at a destination that normally takes 5 minutes...picking up people along the way/dropping them off. I've shared my experience with the City, and they are aware of Uber's shortcomings...plan to address such with the company. Needless to say, Uber is struggling with the ""pool"" algorithms and has chosen to not work with its customers when inequities surface. Uber has lost a loyal customer!

Did you notice that every time you call Uber to complain or ask or do anything over the phone that they intentionally talk slow and always doing some checking in the background and usually the phone call last anywhere between 30 minutes to hour and a half. My phone call was 1 hour and 36 minutes. I have the file phone call recorded. This is not the first time I noticed that the payments are not correct but it is the first time I decided to stand up and call them on it.
After 30 minutes talking to regular agent in 45 minutes waiting for a supervisor to pick up and a 15 minute. They decided to give me the $6 they stole at the trip and when I asked for my time to be compensated how they advertise $35 an hour I simply stated the $50 will do for an hour and 30 minutes or wasting my time. They said that they only get paid if we have a rider and there is no Riders right now to be charged because I was not driving. There's millions of us. If they steal $6 from each and every one of us per day that's six million dollars profit. Now we all know that those amounts are much higher than $6 a day that they somehow unfortunately keep in their wallets. Uber in the past 5 years did not become a 70 billion dollar company because they're paying their Partners fair. Think about it.

Do not lose anything in Uber otherwise your experience will be a nightmare getting them to recognize you. My friend had the ride set up however at the end of the trip I got dropped off leaving my wallet in the black leather seats, black wallet at night. Anyhow, my friend needed to provide verification about her account, no problem, except around 40 emails and 2 days later they didn't accept the email address from her account she provided at signing nor her phone number that she was calling from that she used for this ride. 
It was uselessness forwarding this info to them even as they weren't confirming her own or my accounts. It's mind boggling how the messages we were getting back were not recognizing the very content info we used for the ride. Not sure where their tech support is in terms of usability. I will not be letting them charge a $15 fee for a returned item to say the least! We are threatening police at this point. Apparently the driver has something it's Uber slowing down this whole process increasing the frustration.

Our party of 6 consisted of three of my adult daughters and two friends going wedding dress shopping. We needed an SUV to accommodate all of us, and Uber showed a driver 20 minutes away in Sanford, Florida. Perfect, we thought as the reservation wasn't for another 40 minutes. We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same. We thought that the map must be frozen, so a reset was done, and then it showed that the driver had picked us up and was on route to someplace other than where we were going AND WITHOUT US! To make matters worse, our credit card was charged and we were very late for our appointment.

75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied, but here are my pet gripes: 1) No flat rate from airport, as there are with taxis and limos. From JFK we got stuck at the midtown tunnel and my fare (time + distance) was almost twice the flat taxi fare. 2) The driver's profile does not indicate if they have a FasTrak transponder. Coming from LAX to DTLA on two occasions we were stuck in traffic on the I-110 because the driver didn't have FasTrak and so we couldn't use the express lanes. When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had ""Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No"" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak. Another solution would be to have an option in my profile's preferences, to only accept drivers who have FasTrak.
3) Drivers often don't know the city, relying too much on GPS and so unaware of their surroundings. Taxi drivers seem to know the popular destinations and fastest/shortest way to get there depending on conditions, whereas Uber drivers usually are like little automatons, staring at GPS and unaware that Waze is sending us on an unnecessary 5-mile detour. I recently had a ride to the Broad Museum in downtown LA from my home which is 4 miles away. The driver never heard of it, and his GPS wasn't working.
When I told him it was on Bunker Hill, next to Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Music Center, and near the County Courthouse he had never heard of any of them. Those are all iconic L.A. landmarks - nobody should be allowed to drive for Uber if they don't know the fundamental layout of the city and its landmarks. 4) The Uber App on my iPhone hogs too much memory. I have limited storage capacity on my phone and so had to review and remove some items. The Uber app, >150mb, was one of the biggest apps and so I removed it. By comparison, Lyft's app is only 74mb.

If I could give 0 stars I would. Uber has STOLE my MONEY and has made 3 unauthorized charges to my credit card. On top of that, they are not even taking responsibility for it and continuously keep marking my issue as resolved even though I have proof such as my bank statements. There is no phone number or place I could go therefore they are taking advantage of that. There are random charges on my credit card that total to over $30 and I did not use my Uber app for a few weeks. When I asked them to explain those charges they say they don't know and just ignore me and mark it as resolved. 
Also, just recently, I had to wait for 3.5 hours to have my food delivered through UberEATS, I called UberEATS and complained and all they said they can do is give me a 50% refund, and you know what? They DIDN’T give me that either! I have already called UberEATS 7 times now and they keep saying they will process it but they never end up doing it. As soon as I find a lawyer I am suing UBER for lying, for making unauthorized charges to my credit card, and more. It is ILLEGAL, federal crime to steal money.

I take the shuttle to terminal and do not summon ride until at pickup site. Here is the hurtful thing... Now I could be wrong. While I am looking at the drive from Lyft I get this call from the Uber driver... ""I am outside..."" the way the exchange starts.
Look. That lie I can break down! 1. Within a minute of placing the ride I got a confirmation from Uber… ""four minutes."" 2. Then I get this text ""I have a flat tire. Will you please cancel?"" 3. I replied yes. Now this Old buffalo was not born yesterday. Being at the end my seventh decade of life and having grown up in a small town down south (Alabama)... I smell a RAT and he stinks to hell.

DO NOT ACCEPT RIDE WITH UBER DRIVER ""EDGAR"" IN SILVER TOYOTA SIENNA VAN!!! Me, my husband, and six year old daughter requested an Uber to take us back to the Sanford International Airport Wednesday, October 25th from Disney's Art of Animation Resort. We had a great experience with our trip to the resort the Wednesday prior with Mike who drove a grey Lexus. That fare totaled $40.49 and we tipped him $10. That said, we requested another Uber X for our trip returning to the Sanford airport with the same expected $40 fare - this was the fare provided when we accepted ride.
We later got an email stating EDGAR adjusted the fare to XL due to ""the amount of people who rode"" -- we had THREE total. The fare more than DOUBLED to over $90!!! I had to submit several disputes to get this corrected and STILL had to pay MORE ($55.70) than the agreed rate of $40. VERY UNHAPPY WITH MY EXPERIENCE AND WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN.

For what I'd been subject to while driving for this ludacris company, for whoever these idiots are that intercept these Emails, from, some of these crazy riders!! It gets totally nerve wrecking!! Put up with this nonsense!!! 
For instance, I had a rider, that was very rude and irritating as well as pushy!! So after experiencing another encounter with another rider that occurred a few weeks earlier, where a rider sent an untrue email accusing me, of something that he fabricated and in the mitts of a run some stupid Agent disabled my app. So after the encounter with this rude joker, when completing my runs, I decided to send Uber a email letting them know what happen that night, as to beat this rider to the punch, and giving him a One star rating!! An agent emailed me with this scripted empty apology. So yesterday I received a message from a agent stating my account needed attention, and my app was immediately cut off!! 
After my inquiring what was the problem, it was stated a rider said they were uncomfortable with my driving maneuvers, plus stating my vehicle wasn't clean!!! And that was a blatant lie!! So after rebutting this statement my app was supposedly reinstated, but disabled once again because this same person that was rude and given one star, I guess, was out for revenge! Sent a email stating I had argued with him, which is, something I don't do... It's so very sad that we as drivers get very little consideration from Uber!!! 
I have heard other drivers complain that Uber don't give a doggone about the drivers, and there are too many of these boiler room agent, messing with drivers' livelihood. And so many of these riders are so unappreciative they are getting over like fat rats, they seem to forget how for many years, they were getting robbed by these taxi companies. All Uber has in mind is their profits. It is too many people that are adhering to this madness, becoming drivers and putting up with this BS from Uber!!! My final response, we as drivers are more than a neck, a head, and shoulders, for that what some of these riders seem to think!!! 
All the multitude of DRIVER need to get together and formulated a union and STRIKE hitting Uber in their greedy POCKETS, that would be the remedy!!! Last but, not least, they had the nerve to putting a stipulation in the mix, requiring that attend some 7x7 course and pay $49.00 and send them the result and at that time, they may consider reinstating my app. I told them what they could do with their Uber crap.

I purchased a 100.00 dollar Uber gift card from CVS. After downloading uber app adding gift card on my android phone, I get an error message payment error. I've been trying to contact Uber for over 2 days and getting nothing but automated response from their so called customer service ""help"". After a useless message they have the nerve to send email ""issue resolved"". I'm out of 100.00 dollars. I even went to Facebook attempting to get a resolution same automated response!!! I HOPE THESE FRAUDS GO OUT OF BUSINESS FOR STEALING 100.00 DOLLARS FROM ME!!! No company is too big to fall!! I regret ever considering using Uber. Lesson learned."

We used Uber about 10 times over a week on an Orlando vacation instead of renting a car and had very good results except for the last trip from our hotel to the airport. The initial estimated cost was $21.86 and it ended up taking 20 minutes or so. At the airport we were shocked that we had paid $65.91 and the receipt showed a distance of 74 miles, a trip time of 53 minutes and the map of the route was different from the one that we had taken! We contacted Uber and they promptly refunded the extra cost. Very bizarre - I hope this is an isolated incident and that Uber investigates. If the fare wasn't so much higher than expected we may not have noticed."

I WAS a very loyal Uber customer in the past, especially when I lost my car so I used Uber on a daily basis coming to and from work. Well today I needed a quick ride to get a quick bite (husband was using my car) so I decided, “Hey why not use Uber.” I had heard they jacked up the prices but I never imagined I'd pay 50$ for a 7:00-minute drive. Yes my bill was 46$! THAT IS RIDICULOUS! Never will I use this company again. They are just ripping people off at this point."

Myself & my daughter travelled on 22/10/2017. We checked Uber from Kompally to Gachhibowli and the amount shown is Rs.339 only. When the driver dropped us he has shown an amount of Rs.1324.27 which is not all correct. I have verified the receipt which is showing an amount of Rs.339.40 plus wait time Rs.3.22 total 342.62 but cash receipt has come for Rs.1324.47. How it is possible. It is possible if the driver continues from the previous trip. How the total of Rs.339/- has become 1324? Please explain. I have travelled with my daughter & hence I paid only Rs.500 after prolonged discussion (no use from your Customer care in spite of contacting). So, tell me what nonsense is going on.
Yesterday, another incident happened & it came in Newspaper & TV also. One lady traveling from Hyderabad to Delhi and she has gone to Hyderabad airport & driver misbehaved & she made a complaint at Delhi Airport Police station and they contacted Commissioner of Hyd-Ciber Police Station & afterwards the driver has been suspended.
Please act immediately w.r.t my aspect & give explanation and am going to file a suit against you. Can you refund my time & money wasted. Or else you please pay the compensation. Lot of time is wasted & harassment from your customer care & the driver. We are having the cash receipt scan and it will be attached if you want. Totally the worst services Uber is doing. No OPT and hence all these problems are coming. I don’t have regards to your Company. Please respond or else the matter will go up to any level.

On Oct. 8, 2017 at 1:12:45 PM - There should be No charge for this ride. Despite using a GPS, this driver tried to take a closed entrance to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and then had to detour back to the original entrance Once in Manhattan. And 10 blocks from our theater destination he took another wrong turn and ended up in New Jersey. By the time he got back to Manhattan it was already past the starting time of the play we were going to. As a matter of fact it was already 30 minutes into the play.
Our tickets cost $127. I ordered the Uber car at approx 1:15 pm with an approx arrival ring of 1:42. We arrived close to 3:00. I expect Uber to not charge for the ride and to pay $127 for the tickets to the play that was ruined. This has to be the worst ever experience with Uber. I have spent over two weeks trying to get someone to call me. Their message keeps saying that ""their team is working on it""? I have taken Ubers in various cities but this is the worst experience and cost me a lot of money. So much for a loyal customer! Uber if you read this - Please call.

I had selected my card as the payment method but when I reached my destination the driver requested a cash payment and I obliged since Uber has a refund option for such circumstances but when I requested the refund they give me excuses like it's my fault for not checking the payment method, etc. If that was the case, they wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. This is the second time Uber has done this to me and it is the only reason why I'm lodging a complaint here."

Uber support just sends “canned” responses for questions; there is no escalation path, they don’t seem to read the issue and they have multiple agents responding to the same ticket so you repeat the issue endlessly because they have nobody taking accountability for the ticket from beginning to end. They just close tickets and mark resolved so the agent can increase their ticket count. Worst support department ever - they should implement a rate the support agent so they will get metrics on how bad their support is."

While it is wonderful to be able to get a driver with a ""tap"" of your finger, there is much more behind the ease of the process. I was a driver or a ""partner"" as UBER likes to call us. I drove for UBER for approximately 3 years without incident. However, their support throughout the three years is nothing I have ever experienced. It's predominantly offshore and only app driven. You cannot speak to anyone and the support ""messages"" or solutions are all canned or templates. There is no humanity for ""outside the box"" incidents. I recently had an incident on the freeway while I had a rider in the car. A motorcycle was ""lane splitting"" (in California) and deliberately punched my drivers' side mirror. When I reported this to UBER, they deactivated me and cited I was an unsafe driver. Again, I never had any other reports.
After many hours of trying to get to ONE of the support representative, Paul, via online, that actually broke the template chain and conversed without script, I found the ONE live person in my area. I drove to meet this person. His name is Victor. Victor acted as if he understood my situation as he agreed that I never should have been deactivated and was communicating with PAUL and corporate to rectify. Victor never called me as he said he would. Uber deactivated my account and told me this decision final. They are terrible to their ""partners"", they do not have customer service, and they truly only care about money. We are all a dime a dozen and until we band together they will continue to maintain this low level of service.

This is a complaint about a trip on 28.9.17 ordered at 8.25 a.m. Eastern time in Boston. The expected arrival time delayed a lot, 3 min, 6 min, 9 min, 4 min and so on. Then after approx 12 minutes a message came that Driver ** has cancelled the trip! For reference: the surcharge when booing was factor 1.4. Then my host Jennifer booked for me, meanwhile the surcharge was 2.4. I finally arrived with much delay at the railway station. The driver just cancelled since he expected more profitable trips to perform during that time. This practice was confirmed by another Uber driver in Boston when I openly talked with him. On top of all they charged me 5 USD for cancellation. I did not cancel.

Uber drivers in Sydney (and other cities around the world ) have a bad habit of accepting jobs from miles away and sometimes up to 20mins, while still dropping off a passenger and while there are dozens of cars very close to the new job location. I had one this morning again to take me from home in Rushcutters Bay to work in the city and there were at least 6 cars within 1-2mins from my location. This the ** Uber driver, still took the job while still in the city some 15mins away. Uber needs to do something about this sort of behaviour as it ruins the customer experience and make people angry, if customers want ** service they would take a cab. The solution could be very simple, offer a function on the app for the users to manage a circular area around the pickup zone beyond which Uber drivers are excluded from picking up rides. Simple!!"

After the concert he requested another Uber for the return home to New Jersey. He was quoted the cost would be $55-$75.00. When he left the car the final cost for the ride was suppose to be $75.22.
The next day he received a fraud email from his bank stating that there were 3 charges of $130.80 pending on his account. He quickly called the bank to dispute those charges and he contacted Uber by email to also dispute the charges. He was later charged $130.80 for his return trip.

They only reverse the amount which they would've charged me for the trip but not the cancellation fees. I sent Mr ** an email again and told him that I was not reimbursed with the cancellation fees. He replied to me with an attitude in bold that the driver must get paid for a cancelled trip and at the same time the attitude is ""what do you further want us to do. The matter is resolved and like leave it and keep quiet."" 
I replied again and told Mr ** that I will take the matter further, because I had to make alternative arrangements. The driver just cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee which is not fair and I also told him he doesn't have to have an attitude with me to send me an email in bold.

I noticed that when I Googled Uber, they were giving free rides to new customers so I downloaded the app and attempted to add a payment method. I'm disabled therefore I receive my money on a prepaid (if you will) government debit card. The card is issued through the Bank of America from the government of the United States and Uber will not allow it as a form of payment, nor will they allow me to use my PayPal account which is attached to said debit card. I find this extremely prejudicial towards the disabled sect, as many of us cannot drive or even afford a car, making ride sharing a necessity. I've spoken to Uber drivers who find the map app to be incorrect quite often, getting them lost and making them late. They also find the politics of the company deplorable. 
Lyft, on the other hand does take my government of the United States issued Bank of America debit card, so I'll forego the old free ride bait and switch offered by Uber and ride with Lyft, a ride share company I've never had a problem with, whose drivers are friendly and on time, and don't have to ask me for directions; a company that understands that a prepaid card means the money is guaranteed.

We only started using Uber this past year in Las Vegas, Nevada. A hotel staff member helped us download the app and use it. The drivers were very dependable, prompt and courteous. The cars were much cleaner than the cabs, and the rates were much lower. I am sorry to hear about the scandals that have recently besieged this company, and am hoping that the CEO's decision to take a leave of absence will help this company reform itself and improve its name. Unfortunately, Uber is not allowed to operate in my area, otherwise, my husband and I would use it more often."

I booked an Uber XL from our hotel to the San Francisco International Airport with a 9 a.m. pickup. The quoted fare was $44-$57. Our hotel offered to take us for $17 per person, but we opted to take Uber for the personal service and efficiency. We had an excellent driver and vehicle but when we arrived at the airport I discovered that Uber charged me $99.26! The worst part about Uber is that they make it so easy to book a trip but then they make it so difficult to contact them regarding any issues.
If surge pricing was in effect, they should have given me an estimate of the new price rather than surprising me with the price that was twice what they originally quoted. They have lost me as a customer because this is the second bad experience that we've had. The last one was in Philadelphia when we had two drivers cancel and left us hanging at the airport and the third driver to show up was in a construction pickup truck full of tools and construction material. We have maintained a 5 Rating, so there shouldn't have been any issues with drivers regarding our Uber rating. Uber customer service is completely non-existent and they rely solely on their website to answer any questions. In this day and age, that is completely unacceptable.

Uber drivers that I've dealt with have always been professional, safe drivers, and a pleasure to deal with. Their cars have always been clean, mostly newer models, and well-maintained. For the most part, the drivers get you in a short period time. However occasionally you might get a driver that suddenly realizes he doesn't want to take the call and you suddenly see on the map that he's going in a different direction. That could be frustrating when you're waiting for pick up, luckily, it has rarely happened. Overall, Uber is very good."

Uber arrived to pick me up within 10 - 15 minutes of being called. Clean, comfortable vehicles and good music. Courteous drivers and safe driving habits.

We were left STRANDED in rural Framingham MA, after dark, with no way to return to our hotel. My colleague is disabled and must use a cane. The evening which would have been memorable for many other reasons I am sorry to say will probably remain memorable because of Uber’s actions. The problem all started when the driver showed up at our hotel, the Hotel Sheraton in Framingham, early on Saturday evening, September 24, 2017. We had dinner reservations for 5:30 that evening at a Framingham-area historic inn that both of us had been eagerly looking forward to visiting.
We’d booked an “Uber"" ride that was to arrive a few minutes after 5:00 PM. When the car arrived early, he texted me from the porte cochere, ""SIR [emphasis added], your ride is here.” I carefully responded and noted that he was early. We were not ready. I went outside and spoke to him directly, and asked him if he’d like to wait for my invalided friend or simply leave. He preferred the latter. Fine. I requested an Uber ride again, and I watched on my smartphone as the TWO next Uber cars came and then just “disappeared” from view on the screen.
Well, “PAUL” an Uber driver shows up; we get in. The car drives not 500 yards, and “PAUL” receives a text from Uber saying the ride is CANCELLED. Okay, something must have “happened.” I admittedly know just enough about computers to be dangerous. So I go back to my cellphone and re-request another “UBER” ride. It is at that point I received an error message to the point that my credit card (American Express) has been declined. What to do??? I called American Express, and they told me it was UBER that declined the payment. Uber declined the payment??? WHY??? That question has yet to be fully answered.
After dinner, I requested a ride back to the Sheraton Framingham. I get the same error message: PAYMENT HAS BEEN DECLINED. We are sitting in the dark, in rural Framingham, Massachusetts, with a colleague on a cane, wondering how in the world are we going to make it back to the Hotel Sheraton?? We had been so looking forward to this genealogy conference, to going to this historic inn, and I am terribly sorry to say, the experience has been marred with our treatment by Uber. I shall uninstall the app and NEVER use Uber again.

Arrived in LAX 8 hours ahead of schedule due to change of plans so our pickup wasn't available. My daughter suggested to try Uber so we did after comparing the fare going home which was about the same. A black shiny Suburban picked us up in less than 10 minutes.

Using UBER was a pleasant surprise and I love the fact that they are available on short notice. The prices are much more affordable than the taxi cabs I was using prior to UBER and fare payment via credit card is great. They offer and deliver good service which I felt was safe and everything already in the system and no need to pull out anything. I also tried UBER as driver for several months... It was fun! I only had one incident that caused me concern after calling UBER and confirming a ride. Between 11:00-11:30 pm close to a price surge time, I was switched to several different driver confirmations which caused a 45-minute wait and that night I finally called a cab."

I just had a terrible experience with Uber pool. I ordered it for the first time yesterday on a route that I've taken many times before with UberX. My phone is older, so the Uber app does not allow me to see the fare before requesting an Uber pool ride. However, I'd taken this ride so many times before with UberX and the cost was never more than $50. I figured since Uber pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UberX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car. I received no phone call either. Finally I noticed the car a half a block down past where I was standing. I went to the car and was told to get out because he had already cancelled. I was charged a $5 cancellation fee.
I ordered again from the same location. 8 minute wait. Time goes by, no car. Suddenly my app switches from ""car is arriving"" to ""set your destination"". So the driver cancelled on me again. No phone call, never saw the car. Yet another $5 cancellation fee. About 10 minutes later I get a text from that driver with one word ""waiting"". But by then I'm in my third Uber pool heading home. I respond and get some automated response from Uber. After almost two hours (usually a 30 minute ride), because there were two other passengers, I get home and check the receipt. What is usually a $50 UberX ride is now a $114 Uber pool ride! I am stunned!
So I email Uber. I demand they refund the cancellation fees and justify an Uber pool ride that is more than double an UberX ride. All I get is form responses that that was the rate. They claim surge charges. They try to claim the issue is resolved but I persist. Suddenly I see an additional charge of $48.00 on my credit card. I ask what this additional charge is for. No response. Only after numerous emails do they tell me that this was the quoted rate for my trip for the 2nd Uber driver who cancelled and that they would remove it. So how can they justify one trip being $48, and another trip ordered five minutes later for the same route now being $114??? I persist and they offer to give me $27 credit for Uber pool. Why would I accept Uber pool credit when my app does not show me the price upfront and I risk being charged double the UberX rate? 
So finally I told them I am only willing to pay $50 (the usual UberX rate) and expect a refund for all of the other charges. I still keep getting standard responses. I plan on filing a dispute through my credit card. I am absolutely outraged not only at the ridiculous pool price, but at the previous drivers’ canceling, and above all, at the incredible lack of customer service on the part of Uber. I requested contact information for a manager in numerous emails but was never provided with this information. At this point I will be taking my business elsewhere. I hear Lyft is much better.

I've used Uber many times in the past but I would never use Uber now! Many times I have been billed for rides where the driver literally drove right by me, and I'd have to call for another ride. You are automatically billed $5 if you miss your pickup. INSANITY! The procedure to get your $5 back that has literally been stolen from you is so time-consuming. It simply isn't worth the bother. I already had an unsatisfactory opinion of Uber - before all the HORRIBLENESS that they are today, June 13th 2017... So I'd say, try to catch a Lyft with someone else!"

I haven't had a problem with Uber until now. I ride Uber religiously to work every morning. I purchase their Uber gift card from their app's website. I always purchase a new one before the old runs out so that I have continuous funds. On Sept the 6th I started having major problems. I ride Uber now in the evenings to a new job about 2.26 miles. I currently have a gift card on file on Sept 6 for 50.00 and some change. I took Uber to work that evening but when I got ready to request the ride home it stated I had an outstanding balance of 1.20 cent from my ride to work that evening. I thought that's not right. I have over 50.00 on the gift card last purchased. Here I was at night outside my job trying to figure out where the mistake was. 
I sent Uber an email as soon as I got home stating I had sufficient funds for the ride why was the payment not applied to my gift card. I got an email saying the issuing bank denied the charges... what!!! The issuing bank is Uber and the card was purchased off the website through their app. The next morning the issue was fixed. The issue then occurred again on 09/7/2017. I got all kinds of response through the app that the bank had denied payment and I must put a new card on file. I stated I will not add a new card when I have already purchase their gift card that has now 47.00 and some change and should be used. Why am I going to put my debit card on file to take care of a balance when the gift card that does not expire has more than enough funds on it. One person even said, ""Well just in case you don't you will need to add a new card"". I became very angry because it made no sense!!! Finally a Rhona says the issue is fixed. 
I go look at my account and can see the gift card has been charged the full amount. Nobody could tell me why this was happening. I went and start trying to figure out why so I started with my receipts for the trip. I discovered that whoever is processing the payment is only applying 5.00 to the gift card. Except my ride for Wednesday was 6.20. They only credit 5.00 and left 1.20 owed so this 1.20 will not allow a ride request until I put another form of payment on file. It appears like they are trying to cause this issue by having people to add their debit and credit card. Why would anyone in their right mind do that when they clearly see that sitting on their account is a valid Uber gift card with funds that will cover several rides. The people that work for Uber all give different answers which is a huge CONCERN!!!
You aren't charging my debit card when I already have your gift card on file with more than enough money to take care of the trip. I told them that this is a disservice to all especially those that ride every day. It is not fair and unjust and I am reporting also to the BBB. Once the funds on the card are used up I will no longer do business with them. I had such a great experience in the beginning. I've been riding for a long time but they have turned those experiences into a Nightmare!!

I suddenly became very ill at work. I usually take the bus home, but was too ill to do that. I got on my phone and saw that many Uber vehicles were already circling my block at work, so a vehicle arrived promptly, before I could even come down on the elevator. The driver was a woman who was a previous healthcare worker, and she assured me that I could relax, and not to worry. If I got sick she could take care of me. Talk about customer service! She was so kind, I immediately felt better."

I started using Uber about four months ago. My first two rides went perfectly. I was able to state where I was located, as well as the two locations that I wanted to go to. However, the third time that I wanted to use Uber, I was no longer able to put in two locations, just one. I didn't realize that at that point, and only realized it once a driver was driving me to my primary location. My driver was amazing enough to drive me to my second location; as thanks for this, I paid him with the few dollars that I had in my wallet.
Just today, however, I tried to use Uber once more. Once again, I was not able to put in two destinations. I was only able to put in the one. Uber's Help page did not help at all; after many times of trying, I still was not able to see what the Help page told me that I would see. This was extremely disappointing, especially because of the fact that I had a coupon for Uber. I ended up using Lyft -- and will continue using it in the future. Although it did cost a bit more for me, Lyft allows for me to put in multiple destinations easily and without the hassle of turning to their Help page. In addition, after viewing the Uber webpage, Uber seems not to allow for people to give their compliments or complaints -- it only offers the answers to common questions that people may have. This is very disturbing, which also leads me to turning to Lyft in the future.

I needed Uber when moving to Mexico City for work. I created an account and put in debit card, credit card, and PayPal accounts. Uber said the cards were invalid and that they could not connect to Paypal. I checked with my banks to make sure they had accepted the validation amounts sent by Uber. Uber NEVER contacted either bank to verify my cards. When speaking to Uber, they refused to address this issue. They merely told me how to add a payment method. As far as the PayPal problems, they just ignored that.
While this was going on, I really needed to use Uber to get to and from work, so I bought a gift card thinking that would definitely be accepted. No, it was not either. They also don't take cash. I deleted my account and I expect the $25 to be returned to me. So far, the response is I will get a pin to redeem it. Not sure what that means, as they refuse to return cash to me. I will never use Uber again. I can see why they have a lousy reputation. The arrogance of their previous CEO infects the entire company. Hopefully the new CEO may change that, although I don't have a lot of hope.

Though it was not the driver that picked me, he also ""just happened"" to be another Uber driver.
So I have no way of contacting Uber without getting into my Uber account, and no way of getting into my Uber account without my phone. I guess I will have to wait until my new phone comes.

I recently took an Uber and was checking my trips the next day and see that I was being charged a cleaning fee of $150. My driver's name was Michael and picked me up in Delray Beach Florida and dropped me off in Boca Raton Florida. The ride cost $18.42. When I asked Uber through the Uber help I was advised I was being charged a cleaning fee. I then received pictures of vomit that was on the seat and the floor. This was something that I absolutely did not do. I have asked that the community manager in my area call me and I have not received any response. These pictures that were submitted were not from me.

I never knew there is going to be such difficult task to contact Uber's customer service about an issue me and my husband had. In fact there is no customer service per se but a critical safety response line which wasn't much of the help in our problem. What happened is that my husband left in Uber his wallet with all his documents, id cards, credit cards, pictures etc. He really got stressed out about it a lot, we contacted Uber through an app right away as we were not able to reach the driver. You must know that you really can't reach the driver even though the Uber app would transfer your call to him. The driver never picked up his phone nor there was a voicemail set up so we could leave a message. From Saturday night until Monday night we didn't know anything about the lost wallet. At least he could call back or e-mail us that he found or didn't find it.
If you ever read this driver Syed it's not about that we ""lost hat"" or not even about few dollars that were in that wallet, it's about all the stress my husband had to go through as he lost all his documents. One of them foreign driving license which is not easy to replace. Even that we know you may not find it first, at least simple message that you didn't, would be nice of you as you represent such a large and developing company.

I finally caved and opened an account with UBER in order to take a ride from Hallandale to the Fort Lauderdale Airport to fly home. I was under the impression that the first ride was free, but I could not find the place to enter the code. Nevertheless, I was picked up and dropped off for a charge of $17.94. Once at the gate, I thought I would go back into the app and learn about it, and perhaps discover where to enter promo codes. That's when I saw that a second charge of $97.94 had been applied. To make a long story short, and after a number of back and forth emails with UBER, it seems that my driver Yuniel, who could not speak a word of English, claimed that my dog (which I do not have) had urinated all over his seats. The UBER reply after the fourth email included photos.
What I find absolutely astounding is that it would require multiple back and forth emails and much stressing for the following reasons: I was flying out of Florida and was not in the car with a dog. Had the seat been like that from a previous passenger, I would not have entered the car. I tried to save the picture to try to capture a time stamp, but their ""proof"" cannot be saved. UBER should know that I can have the charge reversed from my VISA, but that won't satisfy me, because that means the driver will still get his $97.94 for a fake cleaning charge. The driver should have known that if he were to make up such a ridiculous story, that he should have perhaps claimed that the passenger was ill (not that I want to give him ideas) or something more believable.
OK - so the driver Yuniel is a thief. But for a company who has a reputation to maintain to go to this length to support a scam is disheartening. I am a 67 year old clean cut person who traveled without a pet of any kind, and I have been taken for a ride (no pun intended), and the company behind the driver so far has done nothing to resolve this except continue to send me emails with the driver's ridiculous claim. Through the magic of a snipping tool I present the photo the driver submitted. Would you have sat there? Not I. I will continue to write UBER until this is resolved. Unfortunately for the company, a single driver has eliminated all my future business with UBER.

I live in San Francisco (city) and have been using Uber for about two years. About six months ago I had the first issue with two drivers that I had to report for violations. My score has always been 5 stars until then, but Uber is allowing drivers to leave a negative rating for riders that have reported them or left a negative feedback due to unprofessional, rude, dangerous behavior. My score dropped to 4.85 because of that. Yesterday afternoon I correctly and honestly paid for two seats (me and my spouse), and when the driver arrived the car only had one seat available. When we asked him to cancel the ride, he denied our request multiple times and stared at us in a creepy way. When he heard we were going to contact Uber immediately, he left us on the sidewalk with bags and kept on making us pay for a ride we weren't benefitting of.
The two passengers in the back seats that were occupying my wife's seat didn't bother to move enough to allow her to sit, and from their unpleasant behavior we understood they were at fault as much as the driver, since they must have paid for one seat only (causing the main problem). The driver, in retaliation, damaged my profile score and now I have 4.82 stars. I have been working hard to restore my score after those bad drivers damaged it months ago, but it seems like riders have no way to protect themselves from similar behaviors. We are constantly at risk of finding unpleasant, arrogant, lazy and even dangerous drivers, and Uber Customer Care doesn't care: all I was able to obtain was a refund, but when I asked them to restore my score I ended up in an infinite loop of excuses and explanations about how their policy prevents them to modify riders and drivers' score.
There is no way bad drivers can be allowed to damage the reputation of good customers when the same customers are reporting an issue with them. I have informed Uber that I have all the rights to move legally, despite what they claim in their fake policy. In particular, don't let Uber's ""arbitration clauses"" which prohibits customers from suing the company scare or stop you from fighting for your rights: in April, a California court ruled that the obscured its terms of service and privacy policy on its sign-up screen, meaning the rider suing the company was not reasonably notified that he was giving up his right to a class-action lawsuit.
Finally, talking about privacy and defamations, if you have been involved in a similar situation be aware that, despite what Uber claims, your rider's profile is NOT private: it only requires one person to see it (the driver) for it to be ""public"". And many are the drivers that takes advantage of a low score to avoid picking you up and behaving badly in any other way. If a driver damage your score as a retaliation for having been reported and given 1 star, then both Uber and that driver can face a lawsuit.

I'm a Uber driver and I took a couple of riders happens to be a husband and wife. When I picked up the riders, the women (wife) was badly intoxicated and sitting on a sidewalk. It was my first time so I didn't know what will happen next. I picked them up from LA and we're headed to Torrance at 1 am. By the time I nearly got to their destination, the wife threw up in my car. The husband helped catch the puke onto his shirt but since it's liquid, most of the throw up soaked into my back leather seat and couldn't do anything about it. I did completed the trip to their home and they got out of the car. 
Since it was my first experience with a rider throwing up in the back seat, I didn't know what to do or how to claim for clean up fee. I used my wet towels to clean up the threw up and was able to wipe out the pukes on the back seat. The alcoholic smell wasn't gone and left my car with horrible puke and alcoholic stinks. I spend nearly more than 10 minutes cleaning and had to open the whole car windows because the smell was bad. My car was just fresh brand new less than an year old Lexus IS. I found in the app that I can request a cleanup fee via Uber. So, I took the pictures and sent the pictures with explanations of the situation of what happened to me because of a rider. I couldn't drive due to alcoholic smell so I had to return home. 
The next day, Uber customer service contacted me via email. Here's what they said: ""If you submit photos of the damage that clearly show a mess, including a wet seat etc., with an explanation of what happened, within 48 hours, we would be happy to look into a cleaning fee for you. The photo you submitted did not show any mess, and we cannot charge the rider if there is no evidence of a mess. I apologize for any inconvenience here. Thanks so much and Uber on!"" After exchanging over 20 emails over 3 days, the Uber didn't pay a penny nor tried to help me on cleanup fee on my car. I was really disgusted and tired of Uber customer's attitude towards the drivers. I heard that Lyft pays $250 straight up detail fee if a rider throws up in the car. As you all probably have dealt with and have experienced with Uber and their drivers, they all say Lyft is much much better for drivers and riders both when it comes to satisfaction.

I have been an Uber passenger multiple times with no problems. When there is a problem there is no one to help. I ask for a phone number and they say they have no phone support. Just email. I was charged double what was stated and my Uber account had me going to a different destination than what I went to. I emailed multiple times with a reply saying ""resolved"". That is the price. I don't think so. No one really read my complaints. I kept emailing until my last email said ""sorry your ride was more than 30 days out, closed"". I have emailed several more times with no response. Uber is right... always, they won't listen to you and customer support stinks! My 16 dollar trip as stated on the app was $33.00. Final!"

UBER does not care about drivers and their vehicles!!! For most issues, they have people responding in the Philippines (initially they say ""We are offshore""), who are trained to use initially prepared ready texts. Those guys do not disclose any unique info like employee ID, ext., initials etc., imitate work on the issue, imitate care, imitate responsibility. Every time a different person responds under the veil of anonymity. You can't talk to a manager. Their system is designed to discourage drivers to resolve their issues, to confuse them and distance them. On top of all, UBER doesn't want to be sued. They want arbitration! UBER also doesn't like class action measures! How is this possible that in the USA the government allows an american corporation to play games with people and avoid responsibility?"

ON 7/30/17 I was in Oregon alone on a trip at the University needing a ride to PDX to get home to CA. I chose Uber over Lyft because they had a driver available and the time of arrival worked for me, I was to arrive at 5:11 to the airport PDX which would have been plenty of time. But with him getting lost to me looking for gas. And me having to use the app to guide him to my pick up locations I ended up being 45minutes late which therefore made me miss my plane. I'm sorry. This is unacceptable from Uber, feeling helpless at the time and that was not what I was quoted. My time that you gave me was to ARRIVE at 5:11 to PDX that gave me 1:35 min to catch my flight I WAS 45 minutes late!
I MISSED MY FLIGHT BECAUSE HE STOPPED FOR GAS AND COFFEE. That is unacceptable. I don't know what was going on with my driver but he was definitely not thinking to make pit stops and to take the streets to the airport >50 miles away. He refused to take the freeway the first time I asked then after he finished his coffee he said ok but by that time things didn't look too good. Thank you. I feel Uber should not be able to assure times and routes if they can't control their drivers. There was no traffic at 3-3:30 in the morning, no reason but the drivers for me to miss my flight!

I feel compelled to let people know they are not the only one seeing hidden charges show up after a ride. I recently was in Boston and actually ran down the street to get in the car early so the driver did not have to stop up further in heavier traffic and was charged a wait time charge? How the heck does that work? No response from Uber yet as just wrote to them. The driver was very nice and a good ride to my destination but that fee is so pumped up just to make more money and I was right at the door of the address I put in that Uber agreed to pick me up at for $14 ride.
So over $15 now as the ""wait charge"" that there was no wait for was put on there. Also, a couple of weeks ago, here in Albany, NY, a $15 charge was what was quoted, but after getting the receipt the breakdown showed a toll and an Uber worker's comp charge. Hmmm, no toll road was taken so what the heck happened there? So I'm starting to think this is not a coincidence, however will print out my itemized receipts with route taken and hold until I decide if I am going to report this and to whom. 
Uber was sooo great when started out. Honest, nice cars, great drivers, and you were billed one fee and knew what it was going to include up front. Again, neither of my situations happened that they billed me for and when you respond to them with the issue, they tell you that is the charge and it is what it is. Signing up for Lyft today. Hearing great things about them and perhaps they want my business more. I think Uber may have issues people. Watch your receipt breakdowns.

A ride with exact same origination and destination with the similar traffic condition and driver availability situation usually taking around $38 now is being charged around $62, and the driver does not get any of the extra charged amount. UBER is naming whatever price they want without supporting facts, and the customer service is extremely horrible, one of them even marked the issue resolved without any content in reply. Please be caution, don't take the ride if the up front showing price on your UBER app is a rip off."

I have honestly lost track of the number of times I have had a frustrating experience with this company. It's got to be at least 10 at this point, within the past year. Each time I attempt to resolve the problem by contacting them through their website, as there is no option to speak with a human being. The process of attempting to communicate with them is, every single time, another giant frustration. I had decided to just stop using their services, as there are many better choices out there (thank you Lyft), but was recently enticed by an email I got offering unlimited $5 rides for a month. I decided to buy the ""pass"" for $5, which would then ""unlock"" the $5 rides. I just arrived home to see that I have been charged $17 for a ride which showed up in the app as being $5. And so I found myself, yet again, writing another disgruntled email, to try to remedy the situation. Please save yourself the trouble and use a different taxi service."

I have only been able to successfully use the app once. Whenever I have tried to get a ride it says ""check your connection"". It never seems to have a problem with my connection when it comes to excessively texting me messages, urging me to become a driver or remembering my credit card information. I never requested info to become a driver, only a rider. When I went online to contact ""customer service"", my only option was to fill in a generic field box.
The customer service number is hands down, the flimsiest excuse for a lack of phone support I have ever heard. It is only a message that tells you to e-mail them and they will get back to you in 24 hours. When I need a ride now, an e-mail is not going to solve my problem. I have tried 3 e-mails in 72 hours and I have yet to receive a reply. Direct quote, ""More often than not, phone messages are incoherent and can slow down our ability to provide customer support"". How about actually answering the phone or use an automated call back service? Or have chat support on your website? Calling a cab may be pricier, but much less aggravating. It's only 2 o'clock and I already feel as though I need a stiff drink.

It's August 2nd here in Dallas Texas and it is raining very hard. I called for an Uber ride to go to an ortho appointment that I have at Parkland Hospital. I was involved in horrific accident in January and my leg was nearly severed and it was saved from being amputated. I've been in a wheelchair for months today was my first to leave the house without a wheelchair or a walker to go to an appointment. It was pouring rain and the driver pulled up.
I close my umbrella and I was trying to balance myself and get myself into his vehicle and he got mad because my umbrella was wet and got water on his vinyl seats and while he was busy throwing a fit he I was standing outside of the car but not allowed to get in until I can move on umbrella and he can dry off the seat. Show being very off put and he was very rude to talk. I told him I would get another driver. Uber did nothing about the matter and they charge me for the cancellation knowing that I'm on a fixed budget and needed that Rideshare money to go towards another driver that I would have to hire from Uber.
Two weeks before that I had another driver who refused to stop at 5 in the morning to take me to an appointment because she did not like our neighborhood. She was from a nicer neighborhood and she said she didn't feel safe picking anyone up in our neighborhood so I asked her why she bothered to take the trip in the first place and then again I paid for a cancellation.

I am an active user of Uber and so, when I saw the service was available in France during my recent vacation, I used Uber rather than a taxi. I left my iPhone in an Uber last Thursday in Bordeaux. I immediately tried to log in to my account and contact the driver but apparently, because I was in another country, they required I provide a verification code - which was sent to my phone, which was in the Uber driver's car. My friend, who is also an Uber user, contacted Uber through her app to file an inquiry on my behalf. We have no less than 10 emails from Uber customer service, a different person each time, asking me/her to file an inquiry online - which would always lead to the service sending a verification code to the phone.
I finally got France Uber to contact the driver on Saturday, two days after the phone was left in the car, and return the phone. The driver, who met me at the hotel, told me that he had contacted Uber about the fact he had my phone 5 minutes after I had left his car on Thursday. Because of their ""privacy"" policy, I could not contact him and he could not contact me. We had to coordinate it all through Uber and their Customer Service and whatever CRM system they are using to track passenger inquiries sucks. Unbelievable for a company of their size.

I asked him ""when there is lot of space why you hit my car?"" He replied saying, ""I want to go to the left edge of the road immediately so I hit your vehicle. If I hit your vehicle you will stop so I can go the left edge of the road to drop my passengers."" This is how the Uber drivers are. Uber is encouraging and teaching their drivers to hit and kill people in order to drop their passengers on time. We are on one way road. He at least does not know that it is one way.

I'm driving for uber, of course as idea uber is a very unique company but bottom line it is taxi company. Only in taxi companies drivers may be non professionals but in uber company I can't see anything that american. Number one being unique company it's not enough to be the great company, and bet is very dirty cheating company, and they cheat not only customers, they cheat drivers, and that automatically mean they cheat government. I warn every customer, driver check your trips mileage and time and compare with charges and you will be surprised that is not matching reality, some small some big but it will be different. Even small different is cheating and if you may multiply that cheating to quantity of trips daily it will be millions, monthly will be billions. Is this is American way? I don't think so.
When driving over 30 miles, but they paying you for 12 and trying to prove that on their gps is that much, when they charges customer but do not paying you, when customer give you tip but it is not reaching your account, when they charge customer and paying you less than 50 percent when it's must be 75, when for 3 month can't fix problems with app in area, I can continue this line list, just check every trip and let's not allow cheating even for penny I think that is real American way.

I have had several issues with Uber especially their navigation when a 10 minute ride with any other service takes 25 minutes to an hour because of their application. I had my last straw yesterday as I requested an Uber that was three minutes away only to stand and wait for 25 minutes. Of course Uber only gives you two minutes to cancel so almost every time this is the case, the extra charge of almost a dollar is certainly a scam as they probably are adding this to many unknowing customers and making a lot of money on this. I don't always pay attention to the email receipts that come in. 
They even indicated that there is a hold put on my account for the lower amount and then turn out charging me more. That prompted me to look on your side and I was shocked to see the lack of customer service. On another note it is almost impossible to have a conversation about a customer experience with Uber. I have tried several times in the past. They are not interested in knowing what the customers think. They also force you to rate their drivers poorly when it is their fault often times because their application and send them to the wrong location. I am done with Uber!

I purchased an Uber gift card in the amount of $25.00 for my son to use. He tried to redeem it, however Uber asked him for a credit card which he does not have... Hence, me buying the Uber gift card for him. In an attempt to satisfy Uber's request, I purchased another gift card for $25.00 thinking this could act as the secondary. Instead the Uber app requested my son provide credit card info again. So, I finally caved and provided a credit card to my son as a back-up payment to satisfy Uber's request. They made such a mess in my account that the bank automatically shut my card down. 
First, Uber charges your account, then they reverse the charge, but this is done over 12 consecutive times causing alerts to my bank. Without knowing, my son at the time purchased another gift card while I had purchased the 2nd gift card listed above in the amount of $25.00 and of course, he cannot use that one either unless credit card information is inputted into the Uber app. This is dishonest business. How can this business sell gift cards if they are NOT going to properly redeem them?
There are lots of consumers that do not have credit card, so the gift card is a good alternative. However, this is much more trouble than it is worth. Uber should NOT be allowed to sell gift cards. Can you imagine buying a gift card to the movies or a retail outlet and then being told they need your credit card information in order to redeem them? How does Uber get away with this business practice? This really causes undue stress to people such as myself who find themselves in this situation, as well as can place people into unwanted situation of proving credit card information.

I have had several recent issues with Uber. I requested an Uber in New Orleans and the driver never showed up. I followed the route and according to the driver they picked my husband and I up and dropped us off at our destination. This did NOT happen. We never received our ride but were charged for the ride nonetheless. When I contacted Uber about being charged but not receiving the ride they stated that the driver checked in and said the ride was given. We were left stranded and never received the ride.
I tried to be forgiving and decided to try Uber again in Orlando. My family requested an Uber xl, which claims to seat up to 6 people. We had 5 people in our party, 3 of them were children under the age of 10. Our Uber driver showed up in a compact SUV with no 3rd row seat. He claimed they could ""squish"" in the back. I was so angry because I was charged for an Uber xl but received a 4 seater car. We had a specific timed reservation that we could not miss. So I took the trip against better judgement and paid an Uber xl fare when it was clearly not an Uber xl. 
While in the car I had to ask the driver to please change the radio due to language. He was listening to hardcore rap music with extremely vulgar content with children in the car. It was totally offensive and inappropriate to me at 59 years old, but to have my grandchildren have to be subjected to it was incredibly offensive and impolite. I sent Uber a complaint on their app but was met with rudeness and incompetence. They stated that the car was an Uber xl according to their policy. I sent pictures of their policy along with a description of the car that picked us up, which clearly states that it is a 5 seat compact SUV (that includes the driver) and Uber still responded in a negative manner. I am so incredibly upset and annoyed. I will NEVER use Uber again and will post as many negative feedback responses on whatever I can. This is unacceptable customer service.

She told me your APP told her to get OFF the I85 to travel through Buckhead. I had to TELL HER directions so I would not spend the night in her car. I want a FULL refund for both trips. I was 1/2 hour late for my dinner appointment. SCAM! Check out the GPS. Unbelievable. GPS it for yourself. Should I really have to give directions and WTF on the miles?"

Today I pick customer up but I wait the 4 minute but he not come out so I did call to him. He not hold the phone so I did cancel it. He come out after I did cancel. I did said call Uber again because I did cancel because rider is no show. He told me that uber is cut money $11 his account. But whenever driver did cancel, uber not pay any money because driver is cancel. I did show to rider I already cancel and I show my account cancel is $ 0.00 so not get any money from customer if I did cancel. Customer need to call uber and refund money.
We don't want to drive more because we go to pick up passenger while on the way, customer is cancel. We are lose the gas. Uber is not pay for that free. And then we wait the passenger 2 minute that time is free. We lose the gas too. We sent far passenger house while sometimes we come back, not get any passenger. We are uber driver and also Lyft driver but we don't want to drive it more. Use own car. Spend gas and we get them a little money.

Uber charged me for faults in their mapping system. I was charged Rs.50 in excess when I booked through UberPass. My fault - I asked the driver to drop me at the front gate of my office when Uber mapping system was showing the drop location as the back gate (Exit only). The funniest part is that to reach the back gate I had to go 1 km extra. So I was literally charged extra for saving my time, the driver's time and fuel. I understand that computers can be faulty at times. But when I contacted customer care the human (I assume) gave me the same script. What is the point of having a human out there if they don't understand logic?"

While staying in Champions Gate, FL, my daughter and friend got an Uber estimate into Orlando at $28 and the return estimate was $28. The first driver took them for the 30 minute drive and dropped them at Church Street after 11 pm. The return driver picked them up around 1 am and brought them back to the hotel 30 minutes and the charge was $63 and stated that it took an hour and 30 minutes. On the map you can see the drive around Buena Vista which was unnecessary. If you know Orlando, you know it's a straight shot on I 4. I drove I 4 that day and there was no construction. It took two emails to get an answer from Uber and they were all over the place with their excuses. Made no sense because it was a straight shot there and a straight shot back. I have used Uber many times but no more. I will use Lyft or go back to old fashioned taxis. How can this business survive with no real customer service?"

After a night out one weekend, a friend called an Uber for me (because I was pretty drunk, and they wanted to make sure that I got home okay). While in the car, I felt like I needed to puke, so I opened the door and did so outside. NOTHING went inside the car, aside from a few small splashes on the plastic of the door. I offered to go buy a water bottle and rinse that off, the driver said that was fine, and while I waited in line at the store, he took off. Left a drunk 20-something girl on the street, not ensuring her safe arrival home. Both myself and my friend who split the fare with me were charged a small fee - UNTIL our visa statements came where we saw a $75 cleaning fee EACH on top of the ride charge. I spoke to many friends and acquaintances, some of whom actually told me that they puked inside an Uber, and were charged $50. 
I tried to get in touch with Uber. Mind you they have no 800#. Opened a ticket in order to get in touch with them, they reply back saying they have policies and put ""resolved"" immediately, which prevents you from being able to write back again. I opened several tickets, in regards to the same issue. Wanting answers, why my friend and I were each charged so much when the vomit wasn't even inside the car. They were extremely unprofessional, even after I asked them to stop closing the ticket they kept doing the exact same thing. They sent me pictures with the first ticket zoomed into the vomit OUTSIDE, the pictures expire fairly quickly and because I could no longer view them, I asked to have them resent, they just ignored my request. 
I explained that, aside from this incident nothing like this had happened to me before, I have a 5* rating on the app. That I understood having to pay a fee, but that this was extreme and kindly asked them to reverse at least my friend’s charge, who was not even in the car at the time, but they're unprofessional, give you short answers and close the tickets each time. Definitely wouldn't recommend this service, they have access to your credit card information and will use it however they see fit. Obviously don't have proper guidelines when my friend who puked inside the car was charged 3x less than I who puked outside. There's no way to remove your credit card information from the app, unless you are to put a new one - I would never give them my information again. For a company that fought so hard to come into this city, they show that they don't care about customers at all. Completely unwilling to work with you and meet you half way.

Uber has overcharged $150 dollars for a bogus cleaning fee. I have communicated with them letting them know it was a mistake since we took a very short ride and no accidents happened. They insist that the driver sent pictures for a mess in the back seat and that the charge was valid. There were two of us, we are in our 50's we were picked up at 11:29 pm and dropped off at 11:39 pm. The pictures are not clear, they show white particles on one side of black seat behind passenger seat. They are still insisting the charges are valid and no refund will be processed. Their time stamp on the incident report is 11:26 pm, obviously we were set up by driver. Shame on them, for what I see online this has happened a few times before. I am filing this report for people to be aware of this scam, take pictures before and after when using UBER services."

I have been driving for Uber for almost 4 months and never had any issues till recently. I received a rider's request, as we can only see the destination until we start the trip, I get to the pick-up location to find out that the trip is an 8 hours trip almost 9 hours which was from Iowa to Ohio. That wasn't a problem because I needed the money. I started the trip, drove to the destination and completed the trip with 5 stars. Right after completing the rating the app logs me off, suggesting that I get back to my home location for me to be able to go back online. The app froze and there was nothing else I could do in it. The red message suggesting that I go back to my home location was the only thing I could read. 
When I got back home (Iowa/Cedar Rapids) I turn the online button on, I check the trip history. The trip is nowhere to be found. I wasn't worried very much as I usually get issues like that with the Uber app but after a few minutes the fare end up showing. I kept waiting until I decided to contact them, they sent me an automatic response suggesting that I should be patient and that it should take up to 48 hours for the fare to show in the app. I have waited for more than 48 hours but nothing is being done. I contacted them on numerous occasions but all I get is a loop of same responses. As per now I don't even get any response any more. 
It has been a week since that happened and now I have nowhere to address the issue. The trip cost the rider $501 and I used my gas money nearly $110. I contacted the rider because he gave me his personal phone number. He says he has seen his receipt either but his has no problem if the issue get fixed and he get charged for the trip. This experience makes me think twice when I get any trip that would last like an hour and above because it is clear now that if there's anything wrong with the app I will lose but not them. This kind of treatment is beyond inhuman. I can't believe these are the kind of people I am working with. And they also treat issues or report that they get in a partial as long as they don't lose. They will favor whichever side that will make them win or not lose anything.

On Thursday, July 13th, I received a text from a male driver that he was looking for me and then a voicemail. 45 minutes later, I received another voicemail from a woman saying she was looking for me at a location. I NEVER requested an Uber. I only signed up to this account on Wednesday, July 12th and used the service once to go from the airport to a hotel. Now I have a charge to my account for a ride I did not request or take. 
I have sent multiple e-mails back and forth to Uber whom they claim after reviewing, they see that the charge did come from my phone device and this does appear to be a valid trip which was charged appropriately for the time and distance traveled, so we will not be able to make any adjustments to the fare. They also suggested to follow up with anyone who may have physical access to my phone to see if they have taken a ride and work out the payment details with them. Again, I was alone and had just opened the account, no one else had access which I re-iterated multiple times and they still send the same generic response.

I used the Uber ride on May 9, 2017 from O'hare to my home. Uber quoted $52.25 but then Uber charged my Citibank Visa $62.24 which is $9.99 overcharged. I contacted Uber to ask for refund but Uber refused at first. I then contacted my credit card company to dispute $9.99 NOT the entire $62.24. Uber then refunded me $9.99 to my credit card so I closed the disputed upon received the credit.
However, Uber places $62.24 on unpaid on my account. My credit card statement stated that I paid the original $62.24 for that trip. I confirmed with Citibank Visa that the bank paid to Uber successfully. I sent Uber the credit card statement indicated that I already paid. However, Uber insists that it is unpaid and demand me to pay again $62.24 on a different card. I refuse to pay twice for the same service and blackmail of blocking my account until I pay the ransom. I provided the credit card statement to Uber as the evidence of payment. All Uber provides to me is their arrogance that I have not paid without any proof.

Trying to get help. On June 29, 2017 Uber started working in Long Island. According to uber if you want to drive you don't need special license special Insurance TLC license, not even a new car 2002 or newer. It sounded really good so I went over to a Marriott Hotel in Uniondale NY and fill out all the paperwork. It was hundreds of people doing it so I was all set to go just wait for June 29 to start driving. With a few days I receive a text from Uber saying going to call him but New York state you need a uber decal. One was already in the mail but in the meantime print a copy and put here in front of my car so I did just like I was told. Runs everything was going smooth. 
I did six seven runs. The last one was going to Mineola train station. I dropped the customer off in TLC. Officer came up to my window ask me for license insurance registration. I got three tickets one of them was for the decal. I told the officer that's what I was told by Uber to put in my car. I showed him the text. I shown the emails. He basically told me to tell them to the judge. They know that having a copy isn't legal and because the illegal decal I got two more. So now I trying to get in touch with them and all the emails address they use and phone numbers cannot take incoming mail or text. I want to see if they want to help me out three tickets I got a court date August 14th and I believe I'm not responsible for doing exactly what they told me to do.

I was returning from a veterinarian's clinic with a very old dog in the back seat. My return route carried me through a neighborhood in which I had resided for 12 years; and, the maneuver from a side street, across San Pedro Ave., where the incident occurred, had been made by me thousands of times before, without incident.
At approximately 2:15 p.m. I pulled up to the intersection of Thames Dr. and San Pedro Ave., with the intent of crossing San Pedro, and taking an almost immediate left onto Sprucewood Ln. I looked both ways, and observed traffic just beginning to move southward from a traffic light up the hill; and, to the south, traffic proceeding down the hill, heading northward, at a good distance. It was one of those rare moments when the maneuver was easy, as no traffic was within enough distance to cause concern, or require any degree of extra caution. I crossed the 2 south-bound lanes of San Pedro, and turned right into the center turn lane, proceeding about 50' to where I would turn left, and cross the 2 north-bound lanes of San Pedro, onto Sprucewood.
At the exact moment I began to move my steering wheel to turn left on to Sprucewood, I was clipped/struck, with little noticeable impact - mostly noise, by another vehicle, without warning - no horn or screeching tires, on my left side, at the almost direct center of the front wheel flare. The car, a black, 4-door sedan, about the size of a Chevrolet Impala, which it may have been, pulled into the center turn lane a few feet in front of me. I was somewhat stunned with the development, and immediately concerned for the dog, given the heat was about 100 degrees, and which, amongst other issues, suffers from incontinence - although he had just recently relieved himself at the veterinarian's.
As we exited our vehicles, I was further stunned with the damage to my car, whose front end was ripped almost completely off. The other driver and I approached each other, between the vehicles. He was tall, about 6'3-5"", weighing about 200-210 lbs, clean-shaven, with reddish blond hair, with no noticeably visible tattoos. He was amiable in demeanor, and immediately asked, ""How do you want to handle this""? Being in a shocked state, I said, ""I don't know"", as I was still trying to get my bearings, and take everything in, and wondering what I would do about the old dog. He responded with, ""I'm an Uber driver; and, I have a fare, and need to get going"". 
There was a person, who appeared to be a female, sitting the rear seat, on the passenger's side. I indicated I had the dog in the car, and needed to get him home. I said, ""let's look at your car"", while, w/o close inspection, was thinking the damage to mine was mostly cosmetic, which subsequently proved to be erroneous. We proceeded around to the front of his car to observe the right front area, which had only a small dent in the front corner thereof. There was also a roughly 3' white/silver scratch down the center of his car, mainly on the rear door, w/o a noticeable dent. At that point, still in a confused state, I asked, ""where did you come from""? He indicated the parking lot on the east side of San Pedro, from which the exit was probably 100-150' above where I had crossed San Pedro and into the center turn lane. He impressed upon me, again, his need to get moving with his fare.
We returned to our position between the cars; and, I asked if he had something to write with. He went back to his car, as I pulled out my insurance card, and a business card with my phone number, which I handed to him while indicating that the email was not @grandecom.net, but rather @Gmail. He took a picture of my insurance card w/his iPhone, and handed it back to me, while placing my card in his shirt pocket. He indicated he would call me later that evening, and immediately took off. Still being somewhat disoriented, I failed to get his license plate number, but have a strong inclination that it started with H, and had a 5 in the last set of numbers. I then called a friend, who came and got the dog, and returned him home, while I tended to get my car towed to a repair center, and reporting to my insurance co. I have had no contact from said individual. A subsequent visit to scene, to take pics, which show no skid marks.
On Friday, June 23rd, I went to Uber's local ""Green Center"", where I spoke to one Tony **, who indicated that office did not having access to Uber's fare logs, and indicated he would ""escalate"" the matter to a district/regional mgr. who did. He also indicated he would discuss the matter with in-house management in a meeting to follow soon thereafter. I was thereafter told, by said person, via email, that only insurance companies and the police will be given that information because it would ""violate Uber's Service Policy"". On Sunday, June 25th, I reported this to the police, who issued an ""incident"" report, not a ""crash"" report #, which is what the traffic investigation unit needs, ""if I want to file charges"". A call to the officer to obtain such number, has not been returned.
My car is a 1999 BMW, 328i, which I bought in Nov. 2016, from a party I have known since the 1980's, who bought the car w/less than 20K miles, and had maintenance records, so I knew what I was getting; and, I've sunk a substantial amount of money restoring it… but, because of its age, it's being totaled by the insurance company; and, I'm looking at a $6,500 hit, at minimum. Moreover, if I elect to take the car and fix it, I can no longer insure it for collision or comprehensive. The insurance company says they have contacted Uber, but it might take 8 weeks to get them to respond, which, as of July 8th, Uber has not done.
In this regard, one would think that Uber would bend over backwards to help identify the driver and his car, not just for my sake; but, for the sake of future passengers. I say this because I'm aware that the Uber app. will show what drivers are in any particular area at any given time; and, that the drivers tend to circulate in a general area. Moreover, one would think that the passenger would have filed a report with Uber, and they would be happy to get involved in resolving this matter, which involved no injuries, and damages of about $4K to repair my vehicle.

I have been using the service for the past one year. Your service is very good. Recently one issue is being observed while a cab is allotted for the ride booked. While the cab is already under a trip it is being allotted for the next booking as it is en route and about to complete its last trip. But it is not the case always. On 30-apr-17, when a cab was booked from my residence, the allotted one was somewhere at about 5km away and further 5km yet to go to complete the last trip and then to reach me. 
Even today 09-jul-17, I just started in a cab (**) from Visakhapatnam railway station towards my residence (about 15km) and the same cab got allotted for somebody booked from Simhachalam. So totally the cab is at more than 20km from the booking spot. Such wrong allotments obviously trouble the customer who may be in urgency. Cancellation is attracting deduction of minimum amount as the driver is not at fault. So he is not ready to cancel. The victim is the customer. Please take corrective measure for this problem.

I was a 4.9 rated driver with over 450 trips. Vehicle depreciation, being contractor, dealing with ungrateful/cheap passengers, and fuel expenses were ok to deal with until Uber spent money and lobbied to have warrant checks and fingerprinting eliminated as employment requirement in Houston. Now the market is flooded with druggies, perverts, and criminals. Uber rather have thousands of sub-par drivers than reward good drivers. This keeps the surge down and in theory more people will use the service if the prices aren't surging.
I had a repeat customer tell me she has had 2 bad experiences with Uber since the regulations were lifted (Uber only spends money on upper management and tech gurus whose sole purpose is to cheat drivers and lie to regulators). Her first negative experience was with a female driver who had her boyfriend in the car with her during the pickup and had just smoked weed because the car reeked of it. Her other experience was coming home from her birthday and a male driver had clutter in the backseat, so she had to sit in the front.
He kept turning on the dome light and making advances through perverted comments about how good her feet, toes, and legs looked. Also, Uber records a driver's every move (they send daily driving reports-braking, acceleration, and speeding). But they don't include these objective/measurable statistics in the driver rating. That is purely subjective and left to the passenger's opinion about the driver. So a drunk cannot like the way you look and give a cowardly 1 star rating because of that. A drunk can type in the wrong pickup address and then give a 1 star, claiming the driver needs to improve pickups. And Uber doesn't reward the drivers who provide excellent service despite the way the system is rigged to USE DRIVERS.

Uber offered me 50% off 10 rides thru July 2 however every time I request a ride they make sure to charge me half off of surge pricing no matter what time of day, whether it's busy or not. Basically half off means I am still paying the regular non surge price. What a rip off. And ploy to get money."

I requested a ride to a medical office that was 0.9 miles from where Uber picked me up. After driving a few miles I questioned if this was correct. I'm not familiar with the area and didn't know exactly where I had to be. The driver pulled into a parking lot and checked her gps and said her Uber app was incorrect. After going 8 or 9 miles I was dropped off at my destination and instructed to contact Uber for a credit. I never tried to change my destination and she always had the exact address. I was charged $20.25 for a ride that should have been 0.9 miles from where I was picked up. After several emails back and forth I am now being charged $15.67 because my ride wasn't timed properly! This is supposed to reflect my proper pick up and destination! If the driver makes a mistake or can't use equipment properly customers shouldn't have to pay for it!"

I have been having constant issues with Uber drivers canceling rides over and over, and with the app sending me a ride that is ""closer"" but turns it after they do that several times it takes like 30 min for the Uber to get to you making you arrive late. And now to top it off, I got banned. And I wrote to them millions of times and
they would just say ""Sorry but your account has been deactivated."" And when I emailed them again, they said they would help but that I should send them a picture of my credit card, my id, and my cellphone information in the about section. I send them that and immediately they write me again that sorry I am not allowed on Uber. Then why did they ask for my information? Are they stealing people/s info now and hacking their phone?"

Their app charges toll when even their driver didn't pay the toll. At time when even the toll plaza is not there, their system charges toll. Their system is complete flaw and they just give excuse that it is designed the correct way. Please be aware when traveling in Pune by Uber. They can charge you toll when even they or their driver didn't pay it."

Uber mentions standard upfront charges for their pool rides but as per the promo provided for 8 kms I have booked a cab on Saturday at 6.02 pm where I was showing ₹59 however as per my drop location I was charged ₹349. I really don't know how I am charged so much & top of that the Uber driver does not have a customer care number & when I told him I would not be giving that money shown he started giving me dhamkis or it can be said that he started talking to me sternly that ""If you do not pay I would not be able to let you down."" However I gave him the money. This is very much unethical & wanted to say that I need my refund as soon as possible because I have sent innumerable mails to Uber & tried to make calls to the customer care but none of it worked out.
Uber will introduce dynamic charges and charge that extra amount to you. And I guess they even charge the person who cancels. So in a way Uber is making 2 way money. They charged me 6 times the normal charge for a ride where I was supposed to be charged only ₹59. I hope I would get a positive revert & my refund as soon as possible because it's a big amount of cheating which is going on.

I purchased an Uber gift card to be able to get myself around to some very important places that I need to get to such as the doctor's office and pharmacy. Uber prints its store-bought gift cards on cheap, flimsy, unreliable paper. After purchasing my Uber gift card with 50 dollars cash (because my credit card is unavailable for use at this time) I proceeded to scratch off the covering of the code so I would be able to immediately redeem it, apply it to my account. Only when I did the numbers were unreadable, illegible, and part of the gift card paper had come off. There is no way at all for me to be able to read anything under that, it is beyond disgusting and despicable. 
If Uber would print its gift cards on plastic instead of paper the code could and would stay much more intact to be readable upon scratch-off. Yes, this may cost a little more but money is all that matters, right? There is no way to void a gift card once it has been activated, so I am stuck with this useless piece of paper I had just paid 50 dollars for. I panicked and begged for help at the store and there was nothing they could do to help me.
There is no customer service helpline to call for help or anything. All one can do is send messages or emails and wait hoping for a resolution to their problem or issue. I did this many, many times and without any success at all, it has been a horrible experience for me. Each response I receive simply copied and pasted the exact same words on their app and website (which of course I already know). I needed help not insensitive robot replies.
After more than 24 hours of email tag and haggling and no resolution in addition to calling Uber's critical accident, safety report line, here I am filing my complaint. I have been severely sunburned by the extreme summer heat and unable to make it to the clinic, the pharmacy, and a friend's house. Uber has chosen to sacrifice integrity, personable , and any immediate assistance or squalor quality of cheap paper instead of durable plastic in the name of profits and cost-cutting, and it has soured much faith I had in this company. My issue still remains unresolved.
Desired outcome: I want the 50 gift card which I paid for applied to my account, plus an additional 50 extra in rider credits applied to my account for my pain and suffering due to no way provided by this business (Uber) to seem immediate resolution to issues such as this. Of course providing a helpline for customers to call or printing their gift cards on plastic instead of paper will probably never happen. However we all know that it should. I am very angry.

My husband and I were visiting New York City. We used the Metro and buses most of the trip, but we were going to Carnegie Hall for a concert in the rain. We didn't want to get wet, so we requested an Uber for the first time. We waited where we were told, on the sidewalk, in the rain, with time to spare. When the Uber driver texted that he was there, we didn't see his car at all. We tried waving at people, but we didn't see them and no one stopped. Then, the drive was cancelled by the driver. So, we waited another at least ten minutes for another driver, which ended up getting us there. The next day, I was emailed that we were charged a $5 cancellation fee for the first ride we never took. My big problem is that when I contacted Uber, they did not understand and didn't do anything to fix it. I did not cancel the ride, and we were standing where we we're supposed to.

Totally unprofessional driver - First when he did not pull up to location he waited across the street from the location. So my son and I had to walk across. NO problem. When we get to destination my hotel was across the street I asked him to make a U-turn and drop me in front of my location. He told me he wanted to go straight so he wasn't making U-turn. He said he would have to go around the block. I said fine with me. I told him I was going to report him. He then sped up the car to the middle of next block and told me and my child to get out and I did leave without incident.
Logged into Uber and reported him. The problem I log into my Uber account and see a charge for $75. I reach out to Uber and they tell me it's because of clean up. If only you can see my face the driver had the nerve to submit pictures of some water on the seats that I did not do. Unacceptable. This driver is a fraud. He needs to be penalized for his actions. I have a witness to my account. He needs to provide a time stamp for pictures he submitted because he is a fraud. And the fact that I was charged additional $75 because I wasn't happy with my services is absurd.

On June 11, 2017, my wife and I attended a Dave Matthews concert in Chicago. Afterward, we were directed by staff security to walk to Michigan Ave. adjacent to the Museum/Aquarium/Planetarium campus to acquire a ride back to our condo as only vehicles leaving the campus would be allowed on the campus roadways. We called for an Uber at 11:06 pm and it was confirmed. We were standing in front of a condo called 1130 - address 1130 S. Michigan Ave. The Uber confirmation indicated our pickup spot would be 1131 S. Michigan Ave. Since there is only a park/greenspace opposite 1130 S. Michigan Ave. we figured the pickup address meant...We had to cross the street! Not an easy thing to do -- Michigan Ave. is 8 lanes wide and BUSY, as you can imagine after a concert with 30,000+ people.
We navigated our way across the street and began to watch my phone as our driver approached for the pickup. When he was a block away - as near as I could tell from the ap - his car disappeared from my ap display and I was notified my ride was cancelled. Great! So, we called for another Uber driver from our new position across the street from the 1130 condo. This time the driver called me to tell me he was parked across the street - WONDERFUL! - in front of 1130 S. Michigan Ave. We had to cross Michigan Ave. again. Back to where we originally started. 
That driver was delightful. When I checked my credit card ap to view the evening's charges, there was a $5 fee posted. I contacted Uber via email and was informed it was a cancellation fee! I didn't cancel - Uber DID! They should be paying ME the $5 for the inconvenience. They agreed to credit my Uber account $5, which I really didn't appreciate. I may never use Uber again. They maintained that company policy prohibited them from refunding me the $5. I protested to no avail and was told the case was closed.
In addition to this SNAFU, each ride I summoned from Uber was for a pool driver to help defray the cost of the trip. We made three trip in all using Uber on June 11. We had to pay full fare for each trip. Apparently, there were no other riders in the vicinity that evening? Not likely! There were 6 festivals in town and the concert patrons made the evening a lucrative one for the drivers. There was a swarm of people out and about around Chicago this night. I was told by one of our driver that due to the number of drivers being called the rates were increased from normal.
My fares were doubled or tripled for the short drives I called for - which is why I called for Uber pool drivers. I'm all for making a quick buck, but since there were so many people needing rides, Uber pools should have been available when called for. It was a classic ""Bait and Switch"" operation, in my opinion. Travel at your own risk, people! There's a reason why Uber is always in the news!

I placed an order on Uber Eats app. Less than a second after I placed the order I noticed I had order 3 subs instead of one and I wanted to remove two of those subs and keep only one along with the other stuff I had also ordered. When I call customer service they are telling me that nothing can be changed or canceled because the order was already prepared. In less than a minute from placing the order and calling they had prepared the sub. Yeah right. So pretty much I'm forced to pay for 2 subs I didn't want. And in the Uber app it gives option to cancel or change your order but when you call they tell you no you can't, so I see it as false advertising."

Uber has a program called Ride Pass that they have rolled out to a lot of Philadelphians. In exchange of a $20 fee, the user would receive UberPool rides at a flat fee of $2.99 and UberX rides at a flat rate of $5.99 within a designated area for a total of 28 days. The only stipulation, is that if the full value of the ride exceeds $20, the rider must pay the overage. (i.e. if a pool ride costs $24, the user would be charged $6.99). Easy right?
I live and work within the designated area, so I was elated to have this opportunity. The trouble started this week. On Tuesday, the ride that I requested had an overage. I take Uber into work, and it rarely goes over $20, so I checked another account that does not have the Rider Pass and lo and behold, the full fare price was under $20. I emailed customer service and they refunded me the difference on two separate occasions admitting it was a system error & that it would be fixed. Yesterday, I emailed them and got a sorry-the overage charges are correct. Today, after providing them with proof that the full fare ride was under $20, and they are intentionally inflating the UberPool prices for their Ride Pass customers, they deleted my account.
I have asked them on numerous occasions for a phone number, but their answers are always cut & paste. I don't really know who to go to for this. It is not the money, I mean, it's literally a $20 fee and under $10 in overages. But it's the principle. People should know that Uber is intentionally offering this program, but then jacks up the costs & it is not fair. I would not have know if I didn't have access to two accounts.

I purchased an Uber Smart Pass a week ago and I've noticed several lies within their promotion. When I first purchased it, the app told me that anything under $30 would be covered within the Smart Pass range. Now that verbiage has changed to $20. Also, since purchasing the Smart Pass, Uber drivers have been canceling rides left and right. I've had drivers arrive AT MY APT. and cancel the ride for no real reason. The most annoying part is being charged $5 each time. I can't comprehend why the service charges YOU whenever the driver cancels. That's insane. Charge the drivers for being inept or money hungry for a ""better ride"". Don't punished your loyal customers.
I was scammed last week when a ride to Brooklyn was supposed to be $15 under the Smart Pass. I received the receipt and it was over $35! When I contacted Uber, they gave me the runaround and said it was merely an estimate. I told them that was ** because I had a screenshot of the ride. It wasn't an estimate. They refused to refund me the $15. Uber is a joke. Once this Smart Pass has expired, I'm deleting the app.

I kindly ask you refund everything in the scenario where you would have killed someone.""
I can't believe after all this they still charge me and would not refund. Uber does not care whether you live or die, you have to just pay their fare. They employ people who drives drunk crashing car in the middle of night and if you turned out alive after that they will leave by the side of road and still charge for that ride. And you wait another half hour to get to another Uber with no option and pay another fare hoping to reach alive and out of all this Uber says our partners tend to have high standards.

I expressed that I don't have family here, I stopped in a store and have a receipt during the time the driver claims he dropped me off. It's the principle of the matter. How do you report that you drop someone off that never got into your vehicle that didn't even know you were coming. I would've preferred a ride home versus walking for 30 mins.

I have been emailing back and forth to Uber about this, but every time it is always someone different replying to me and it is as though they do not even read the previous replies. All they keep telling me is that the charges are legitimate. The first time they told me it is legitimate, then I relied and told them that I was charged and I have my bank statement to prove it, then the next person tells me that it looks as though the charges were disputed and refunded to me, then the next person tells me the charges are legitimate and does not read the previous emails. 
After, a long time, I finally get someone that said the money was refunded in April and asked me to send my April bank statement, which I did, but then they tell me it looks like in the system it shows it was refunded in May and to send the May statement which I then did, and now the reply to me again is that it looks like the charges are legitimate. This is really ridiculous because no one seems to be able to understand that I was charged and never refunded any money.

I reached out to them with specifics of the trip I completed and they basically said if I didn't have exact records of the trip they couldn't prove I made the trip and didn't provide me with an explanation as to what could've happened or who I could reach out to to file a complaint. I signed up with Uber because I thought it would be convenient not to drive people around for free. Very disappointed. If you choose to drive with Uber be sure to screenshot or document your trips because if your money goes missing they will not help you!"

First, my complaint is Uber REFUSES to call anyone so you can have a conversation about your dissatisfaction. Second my complaint is that they are running a bait and switch that is unethical. My TRIP: THE ISSUE is that their app told me I could USE UberX for a trip from the Indianapolis airport to my house in Cincinnati and the fee would be $115. I checked it 3 different time during the week to confirm the rate wasn't a error. When I got to the Indy airport from FL I checked it again and the app said my cost would be $115. WHEN the driver showed up tells me that I can't use UberX but had to select UberXL because of the distance of the trip.
If that was the case then their app should have alerted me FROM THE BEGINNING that I could only use UberXL for that distance. If it would have said that THEN I would have rented a car for $90 instead of having to pay $235. At that time I had no choice because I had to be back in Cincinnati at 3pm. Therefore, my only choice was to follow the driver's instruction to ACCEPT the ride with UberX for a short ride (which I did) and then resubmit the request under UberXL again which I did. Instead of the fare being $115 it ended up being $235. 
AND... it seems no one at Uber can understand my frustration and NO ONE is willing to have a conversation with me, which is absolutely ludicrous! They know that if I would have thought the ride would cost $235 I (or any other logical person) would have rented a car and they would have lost the fare. Complete bait and switch!

My name is Scott and my husband was working for Uber. He had a ride with 3 people in it. When they got in they had a metal smoking pipe that they put out on the hood liner of my car. The pipe was left in the car and a burn hole in my car. He sent pictures to Uber and they said that they needed a quote. So the first quote we got was almost $2000 from Chrysler since that's my car. We only received the quote over the phone. It was too far away to drive so we called Chrysler near us. They referred us to a person that gave us a quote of about $300. He sent the quote to Uber and they got back to him today.
The insurance company called him and said that it was a $1000 deductible. So the amount had to be over 1000. We had sent them the $300 and they said they were not paying for it. He contacted Uber again and they messaged him back telling him that they tried to charge the rider but the rider has to agree to it. Of course they did not want to pay it. They said that the insurance company has the final decision. Now I'm left with a burn mark from an Uber rider and nothing is going to be done. Uber is the worst company to work for. They even just cut the pay on all their drivers. The pay is not worth the damage. Thanks Uber for ruining my car. Lyft is way better.

My Uber Account was hacked today. Uber does not have a customer service line that you can contact. I was unable to log into my account to remove my payment information due to the hacker changing the email and password onto my account. Uber's site says to send them an email and someone will contact me within 24 hours. That's not acceptable. I've had to cancel my credit cards right before Memorial Day Weekend which doesn't make for a pleasant holiday. Thanks, Uber, for your ZERO customer service.

I am wondering if all the Uber drivers are given the ability to actually fire clients... making it so that they and their families can no longer use the Uber service and on top of that... rob that person of $50? There were 2 cancellations on this evening both by the same driver in the same hour. On this night my 18 year old son (who had struggled from kidney failure since birth and whose growth was somewhat stunted) was hanging out with friend at the ""sci fi factory"" near Keller TX was ready to walk the 1.5 miles home when I told him just to wait and I'd get him an Uber. The Uber driver pulled up... took one look at my son and screamed ""you have to be 18 to ride!"" Then he pulled away leaving my son standing there. Never asked for ID... never even gave me a call! 
My son informed me of the situation... I immediately set a ride to take me from my home 1.5 miles down the road. Again that ride went to the same driver who then cancelled it as well. So I had to reschedule a ride to my son in order to ride with this 18 year old 1.5 miles down the street. The next day my Uber account was shut down with a $50 gift card attached and shortly after that my mom who was linked thru the family Uber program also reported her account to have been shut down. 
I loved the Uber program up until this. I have written several complaints requesting just my $50 from the gift card be returned and my request has been ignored. No one has ever asked me what happened... This driver simply concluded my son was less than his 18 years and I was immediately convicted and punished for an error in his judgement. It is now my goal to spread the word about the customer service I was shown and hope it doesn't happen to anyone else.

I noticed that the reviews for Uber were low on this site so I felt compelled to share my positive experiences with readers. My husband has been using Uber for quite some time because he does a lot of traveling with his occupation. We used Uber together on our trip to San Juan Puerto Rico recently and every ride was 5 star and top notch. The drivers were friendly and professional. All of the vehicles we rode in smelled fresh and clean. We actually had a taxi driver harass one of our drivers and although we had our Uber driver pick us up at the business next door to our hotel, the taxi driver could tell it was Uber because my husband had his phone in his hand & we waved to the Uber driver. I can honestly say that due to the taxi driver scaring me by bullying our driver, I will NEVER take a taxi again as long as I live. Last I checked, we live in a capitalist society and competition is good for us. Taxis should not have a monopoly! I highly recommend Uber."

I started driving for Uber because of the referral bonus. Figured why not drive and I get 300 dollars and my friend who referred me get 300 dollars. Fast forward me completing the 40 drives they tell you to make in a month, in a week and they say that, ""We didn't mean the money was a bonus on top of the money you made. We meant that you were guaranteed to make 300 dollars giving 40 rides."" Of course I was. That's no incentive. Lyft pays out the 300 dollars the moment you complete the trip. I complained about this stating I do not want to work for a company with such bait and switch practices and instead of resolving the situation they deleted my driver app and my rider app and didn't even let me cash out the 100 dollars I made that day."

I just want to highlight the inconvenience that has been provided by your company app to my friend: Apoorva **, her account has been blocked since a week now and we both have been trying to get in touch with your company via email and all we get in reply is that your system raised a flag and blocked us. Lol. ""FLAG just because we were updating email address."" And you want us to also ""Appreciate your understanding in this regard."" - LOL. We have all our invoices blocked in that account. Hence it's a request if someone with some logical sense can have a look at her account and get it sorted for her. Systems can do errors, but who accepts their mistakes these days. All we want is our invoices and we will make sure never to bother Uber again for any ride. Ola is way more better with respect to quality app. 
Last thing I remember when the account was working that we were updating email address to get invoice on email and yours mathematically correct systems blocked us down just because we were updating our email. Really Great Coding And Super AI. Finally a person from your company updated our email address but when I tried to log in I noticed that the flag was never removed.
If by any chance you find that we are real and her account is real and if she is real and if anyone from Uber can read and understand about what we are trying to say then please go ahead and email us all the invoices: **, or remove the wrong flag raised by your super system Generation 6 so that we can download it manually. Attached image shows that we are suspended and Uber can't even share the reason for the same - Because email team may have some procedures and rules which they have to follow blindly, to which I think that the rules have been made by a mentally blind person.

I use my corporate card for business trips when I use Uber. My company told me I have a charge for $3.80 that I need to show proof for so I went to my Uber app and seen that I never took a trip on that date. I reached out to Uber and explained to them that I was charged but never took a ride. The first response was someone telling me to send my bank statement and they will be happy to reverse the charges. I asked my job to provide proof as I don't get statements because it's my corporate cards.
I sent a PDF with the proof and was told they are not able to make fare adjustments to trips that were completed 30 days or more ago. I explained to them that I was just informed by my job that I had this outstanding charge on my card and had I known about this charge sooner, I would have been reached out. Then I get a message saying they have not been able to locate the charge, to send the posted date, transaction description, amount and type of account. I had already sent the PDF with this information, but gave the information again. Then I received another message saying they are not able to make fare adjustments to trips that were completed 30 days or more ago.
I also asked, ""How can I make a fraudulent claim,"" and I received the same message and they closed my ticket out. I responded for a manager to call me and I have not received a response and it's been more than 3 days. I'm frustrated with Uber that I have to reimburse my job $3.80 for a ride I did not take and Uber can't even locate that they charged me. $3.80 is not a lot of money but it is the principle that Uber should have done right and refunded the charge instead of sending generic messages. Now I will use Lyft for my business trips because I don't want this to happen again.

I am an Uber driver. I want to comment. I try not to cancel. I have had plenty of riders when I show up at their destination are not ready. I usually call them after 5 minutes, most of the time they are on their way and I wait. I have had some whose phone goes to voice mail and I waited a few more minutes they come or they don't so I cancel. Uber drivers do not get paid if they wait after 5 min and the rider cancels which has happened to me, which pissed me off, especially when it is a long trip. Riders need to be outside on time or call the Uber driver. I have never canceled due to a destination, but better yet, who wants to maybe drive as I did a long distance and upon arriving have the rider cancel and don't get paid. No excuse."

My family recently visited NYC and my dad has had great luck using Uber in other cities in the past, so when we couldn't get a cab easily, we took Uber quite a few times over our 3 day trip. Some trips were great, some were just okay, but one of them was beyond bad. We were traveling from near Times Square to Battery Park (we had reservations to be on Ellis Island at a specific time). We selected Battery Park as our drop off point, and told it to our driver again when we got in the car (the dirty, smelly car).
None of us are from New York, but even we know that Battery Park is at the bottom of Manhattan, I mean really it's not some obscure location. We realized we were getting close, and then for some reason, we were going through a tunnel. When my dad tried to ask the driver why we were going through a tunnel, he couldn't really answer the question, because he spoke literally no English. I'm super glad that Uber is open to hiring all cultures and everything, but I do think that drivers should speak enough English to communicate with passengers about their route and destination.
As we emerged from the tunnel a few minutes later, it turns out we were in Brooklyn. Now again, I'm not from NYC, but I 100% know that Brooklyn is NOT on the way to Battery Park from Times Square. As we tried to explain to the driver that we were clearly in the wrong place, he was still so confused. Eventually, we had to pull up our own GPS and attempt to get him to the right place. We ended up having to get out a few blocks from Battery Park and run to the ferry to try to make our reservations. We ended up missing any time on Liberty Island, simply because this driver had absolutely no idea what he was doing. To add insult to injury, while we were on the ferry, my dad received an email of a fare adjustment because there were tolls on the tunnel (about $10).
When we contacted Uber, after quite a few messages they finally agreed to refund just about half of the fare (half of the total that included the completely unnecessary toll charges). This driver made a completely incomprehensible mistake, ruined part of our vacation, and to be honest, it was a little scary when we knew we were in a stranger's car heading somewhere unknown. I think that if Uber is going to send completely unprepared and irresponsible drivers out in their name, they need to stand behind that and offer full refunds for experiences as bad as this.

I am very frustrated with Uber. 2 days I missed my bus because of Uber and their foolishness beyond my control and I want my money back. I am dissatisfied with not being able to talk to 1 person instead of 3 and 4 different people by email through the Uber app. Ridiculous!!!! This all started last Friday 5/5, I requested Uber at 6:28, my Uber took a few min. but Pineda came at a reasonable time. My stop is 5-6 min. from my house but the stupid Uber app told the driver to go in the opposite direction to get the other rider 15 min away and therefore made me miss my 7 am bus. So I then had to take another Uber because the next bus was 7:35 and that would have made me even later for work. Not only that but I have taken this ride several times and it cost $6, why was I charged $9.30. The receipt even says $6.26. So now I have to request another Uber to get me to the train. That was another charge but it looks like they took care of that one from Friday. 
So today's 5/10 events were even better. I started requesting the Uber at 6.30 am so, 2 Ubers cancelled on me back to back. The 3rd Uber request went in but the the app said he cancelled. So I tried getting another driver but the 3rd driver ended showing up but of course by then I miss the 7 am bus again, so I had to request a 4th uber to the train station to get to work once again late! I want those fares credited for the inconvenience you Ubers have caused. $5.14 and $4.85 are the 2 fares I had to take and get the train on time. My boss is threatening demotion if I am late again this week!!!! Customer service/support does not work and the in-app help sucks. I had to send a message on each charge in question and now have several different people in several conversations. RIDICULOUS!!!!
This is frustrating and no way to deal with customer issues. Where is the customer support??? I wanted to speak with some immediately but I have to go through all of this red tape and drama. ** and still no one from Uber has called. I messengered them on Facebook and once again they tell me to go through the app and open every fare in question and tell them my dilemma for each incident! UGH!!! RIDICULOUS.

I decided to try Uber Express Pool after work because of its advertised lower fares. I scheduled for an Uber Express Pool on Monday at 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm with a fare for $3.75, which is pretty decent. I had no issues. Because it went so well, I decided to schedule an Uber Express Pool again after work on Tuesday for the same time, 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm. Surprisingly, it was the same price, $3.75. When I finally got dropped off home, I received an email receipt saying I was charged $20.61 for surge pricing, booking fee, the distance and time it took to drop me off. 
This is absolutely ridiculous as I had no prior consent or knowledge that this would happen. I tried talking to Uber Support about this issue and demanded compensation for their shady marketing but all they kept saying was ""surge pricing"" occurred in the area and there was ""higher demand"" around the time of my pick up. IF I was notified prior to the driver arriving, I probably would've canceled because getting Uber Pool would have been significantly cheaper than the bullcrap they just pulled off here. I am highly dissatisfied with how this went down and the lack of explanation from Uber Support. I will NOT be using Uber ever again in fear they will over charge me again.

I have had a few issues with Uber in the past few weeks and overall, I am disappointed because I feel that my time and money are valuable and this is not being respected by Uber. The most recent issue was yesterday, when I ordered UberPool, however was charged an UberX fee. If you look at my past ride history, I am well aware of how to order Pool vs UberX. The same thing happened to me on 5/1 (UberX instead of Pool), however I believed it was my mistake and did not say anything. Yesterday, however I was very careful. The difference between Pool and UberX is significant and I am frustrated that I have paid so much extra, for no fault of my own. What is worse is that when I wrote to Uber Support, I was given a generic reply where they had not even attempted to fill in the automated blanks, and they would not respond to my messages.
Secondly, last week, I wrote to Uber as my driver asked me to walk 10 minutes for the pickup point. I had a lot of groceries and requested Uber so that I would not have to walk. I was not impressed, and my co-passenger in UberPool was annoyed at me because it took me 10 minutes to walk to the car. It was not my fault! I had put in the correct pickup address. I had ordered UberXL 4/22, I believe. At the time I ordered it, the ETA for pick up was ~ 4 minutes. However, the driver made a wrong turn, and it added 20 minutes to the pickup time. By the time I wanted to cancel, it was past 5 minutes and I did not want to be charged a cancellation fee. I felt that the driver was also unprofessional and did not answer my 2 attempts at contacting him. Once again, Uber Support blamed me and did not even try to acknowledge my concern until the following day - I am sure you will be able to find the thread.
I use Uber and Lyft frequently as it is my primary mode of transportation. I have not faced any issues with Lyft in the past. I like Uber because the app and algorithm seem better, however, based on my experiences, I know feel it is safer for me to use Lyft moving forward because I am frustrated that I am losing money and time with Uber. Lastly, I have been on the ""List"" to be notified when Flat Fares are released. Both times, the option has NOT been available to me, and my boyfriend can buy passes. When I contacted Uber, they simply replied that the passes sold out (Not true as my boyfriend could still purchase them), and then Uber told me it's not available to every Rider. Seems discriminatory.

I ordered a ride to get to work, the ETA said 15 minutes. The driver showed up in 8, and while usually that would be seen as a positive thing, I was not ready to leave yet since I thought I had 7 more minutes. Uber has a feature where the driver cancel the trip 5 minutes after arriving at the destination and it automatically charges the customer $5 even though no service was provided. This happened to me all within the 15 minute time frame I originally agreed upon with the initial Uber request. It's only $5, but it's a matter of principle. On top of this, their customer service is nearly non-existent as they don't even have a phone number to discuss this with anyone. You can only correspond through email which is very impersonal and a massive hassle. I cannot believe how shady they came across with this. 
I will personally never use Uber again and will do my best to make sure everyone I know goes to their competitors like Lyft and steals profits from them. It was seriously only $5 and they REFUSED to give it back after several emails back and forth.

First time using this company and last one. Uber has a glitch in the system and the driver was directed to another address. I called him and he refused to come to my pick up location and Uber charged me $5 fee for canceling. I ordered the same service for a second time. The same driver and the same issue. He was sent to another place. I had to walk one block. Upon arrival he showed me Uber sending him to a place that I did not request.
The driver barely spoke English and it was almost impossible to communicate. He did not know the area and took the wrong way, actually the opposite was I arrived late, and I was overcharged waiting time (I had to wait and I was charged due to their incompetent system and also a ride quoted $ 18.86 ended up in $26.02). They overcharged me waiting time that it was their fault and time that it was the driver's fault since he did not know how to get to my destination. I will never use them again and will dispute the charges in addition to make reports to all the involved government agencies.

I'm informing you of some issues that are occurring while using these services. My girlfriend uses uber 5 days out of the week to go to both her school and her work each day. However, we have noticed more lately that the uber drivers keep canceling the rides. It will say they are arriving in 13 mins or however far they are then when they get close they cancel the ride so we request another trip but no 1 is available or it takes up to 15 or sometimes 20 mins to even get another person to accept the request.
So in these cases she has been late to both work and school several times due to the cancellations of the uber drivers. So we have had to resort in getting lyft instead. I understand that sometimes things come up which might cause a cancellation however when you're working for a business where you're getting paid to provide a service such as transportation to people then I don't believe having multiple people multiple times cancel on you looks so good for the company. Word of mouth goes a long way.
Maybe there is a way the company can prevent the drivers from canceling or make it something that they have to come out of pocket a couple dollars to make up for the cancellation to encourage the drivers to not cancel. Simply because if people such as my girlfriend and I rely on uber as a means of transportation that is being used daily and I know many more do the same and if they are having the same issues it doesn't look it nor does it help either side ours or yalls drivers. If people go somewhere else for transportation then Uber loses out on money which means they wont have the money to provide people with jobs. So uber needs to step their game up. Start by making it not a convenient thing for the drivers. If they sign up for a job and accept the drive then backing out of it should not be an option.

But I had to ride in the FRONT SEAT of a teeny-tiny, red 2-seater. I had to hold my luggage on my lap because it was so small. And worst of all, it was driven by somehow who didnt know how to operate the GPS. He said, ""Sorry I dont know how to use the updated system."" For more than half the ride, the GPS kept trying to redirect us back to my house (the starting point). I was having to try to figure out how to operate the system for him. Which is not what I paid for! It was incredibly stressful.
More than halfway through the ride, he realized that he hadn't properly started my ride. So I can't even be sure how the final rate was determined. It said it was a 14-mile ride, but I live 11 from the airport. I contacted Uber promptly about the experience and received an e-mail marked that it was resolved. However nothing was resolved. I was not issued a refund. When I followed up after my trip, they asked me to state why the driver's vehicle didn't match the app description.
How would I know that? Don't they vet their drivers? They should have just issued a refund immediately. I've disputed the charge with my credit card company and filed a BBB complaint, because I don't plan to be treated poorly. I've had some scary experiences with bad Uber drivers, but this is my last. It's not worth jeopardizing my safety or sanity to save on a cab ride. You get what you pay for, and these people are not pros. I want a pro driving me through Atlanta traffic.

I just wanted to know why Customer Rating is displayed on Uber app... What it is related to... So based on this rating, do drivers have authority to cancel our booking?? Or just to show customer that you have to keep quiet if at all you are unsatisfied with the experience... I mean we should give a rating of 5 to all drivers so that they should give us a rating of 5... From my point of view, customer should have a chance to rate a driver as it can be useful for other customers while selecting a cab... But in this case, I just wanted to know why you are providing drivers to rate us... So in this case, as how Uber drivers will be asking us to give rating of 5, we should also ask them to give rating of 5... So do I mean it correct?? 
For this only reason, I uninstalled Uber app and I am not using this app... As per my understanding/view, drivers may give rating but it should be confidential to company data only. It should not be displayed to customer/to any driver... If at all in any case, customer is very aggressive and so, based on his rating given by the driver, the company should have the right to block him on booking a ride...

So I am away in Vegas and I called an Uber for my daughter in Los Angeles to pick her up at school and take her home. I've done this tons of times with Uber. The school 10 minutes or 3 miles away. It is straight down the street. So I see a charge for 12 dollars and I look and I see the Uber driver picked up my daughter, drove past my house and took her 20 minutes out of the way and then took her back home. So I say that has to be a mistake. I dispute it. No way a 10 minutes ride is more than 10 dollars and I picked a Uberpool so no more than 6. The driver picks up a second person DOWN THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE and goes and gets on the freeway. My daughter let him know he's going in the wrong direction and he still take the second person home and then bring her back. Making a 10 minute ride 30 minutes.
So the first dispute I get this: ""Thanks for reaching out. We reviewed your trip and it was already adjusted to the estimate to account for the route taken. We're sending you an updated receipt so you can see the adjustment that took place. Refunds generally take between 3-5 business days. Let us know if you have questions.""
That brought my total down to 8 dollars. So I wasn't happy with that. I let them know there's no way I am overpaying for a mistake on their part. Because who does that. Overcharge the customer to make sure they still make a profit. Because their driver messed up clearly. This is the second response: ""Your driver let us know that the trip recorded incorrect pickup and drop-off points. With that in mind, we adjusted this fare to reflect the actual trip so your driver could be compensated for the full service they provided you. If you have more information to provide us about this trip, please feel free to let us know so we can help. Thank you!""
So I said I didn't send incorrect pickup or drop-off locations because I have never had a problem with this before. I had called Uber from my phone to pick up my daughter when I am not with her many times more than 20 times I'm sure. I've used their flat rates and brought 40 trips a month at least. So now all of a sudden my location was off.
Nope wasn't having it so this is the last response from Uber: ""Your uberPOOL fare for any destination is set when you request pickup. Fares for other vehicle options like uberX and UberBLACK are calculated after you arrive at your destination. With uberPOOL, you'll always know your guaranteed fare before you ride. In this case, we are able to make an adjustment to your fare. You will receive an updated receipt with your new fare breakdown. Moving forward, please use the correct destination when requesting a pickup in order to see an accurate upfront fare and help us match you with riders heading in the same direction. We appreciate your understanding. Thanks for getting in touch.""
So after this I told them, “Thank you for getting the price correct.” and I will never use their services again. Because this not the first time this has happened. And for them to tell me to make sure I was right on locations when is the last 6 months I have never had a problem before. But what they should have said was, “Our driver made a mistake. Here is a refund for the overpayment and have a nice day.” But I thanked them for their service but I will not be using them ever again.

Multiple experiences with Uber India via email has convinced me that their staff's competence, training level provided to them by Uber India and their internal group who frames processes for non US countries SUCK BIG TIME. I have used them in the US sparingly mostly to & from airport trips. Never had an issue with promptness, billing and quality of ride. Ride quality - one expects clean vehicles on pricier rides. Nopes. Many stink worse than a public transport. Billing - despite using same credit card on multiple previous occasions, I am told they can't charge it on some of the rides.
I use the same CC for Ola, no problems. In every email interaction, they respond with one of 3-4 boilerplate replies. They NEVER read your actual comment or complaint. I suspect they use automated software to look for canned (or most common) keywords... and system generates an appropriate automatic reply. If Ola improves themselves by just 10% overall, Uber will be history in India.

I drove for Uber for about 4 months in Tucson. Riders are a bunch of crybabies who will leave a 1 star review if you don't let them drink their coffee in your car. Uber has fostered this mentality with its feedback system giving the rider a disproportionate amount of power. It was common for a rider to be disrespectful or abusive. Riders Never tip. Getting paid 95 cents per mile is nothing for what you put up with: traffic congestion, unreasonable riders, canceled rides, wear and tear on your vehicle, increased insurance rates, long waits at the airport, drunk riders, etc. 
Go to Uber's website and you will find no mention of the expenses involved with using your vehicle in ridesharing--mainly maintenance and depreciation. YOU ARE NOT BEING COMPENSATED FOR THIS. AND UBER DOESN'T WANT DRIVERS TO KNOW THIS. This is the dirty little secret in the rideshare business. There's a reason why 50% of drivers are no longer with Uber after 6 months. ANY job is better than ridesharing.

I had requested a pickup and app showed 3 minutes, then 6 minutes, then 7 minutes so I cancelled and decided to get the bus. While waiting at the bus stop about 5 blocks away, the driver called and said he was there. I told him I left but he asked me to wait for a couple of minutes. Despite the fact that the bus was only 5 blocks away, he couldn't find me. My dumb decision as I let two buses pass by and as the 3rd bus arrived, my driver pulled up and told me he found me because of the passenger in the car. The first thing was that the driver was new, ok no problem, but the car had the overwhelming smell of flowers that you couldn't breathe. Then he took me on a circuitous that resulted in me being trapped in downtown traffic the complete opposite of my direction. 
After watching another two pickups get dropped off before me, I got out of the car in the middle of traffic at a stoplight. Given where I was, I jumped on the underground and made my way home and can guarantee that I made it home faster than the Uber would have got me there. And that flower smell was embedded in my sweatshirt. Overwhelmingly strong. I was embarrassed to be next to anyone. Now, I can't find an easy link or phone number to complain to Uber. Heading to Lyft.

I then found Uber tried to charge me $5 for the ""experience"". I disputed the charge and got that taken off my credit card. Not paying a penny for botched service.

I was charged a cancellation fee by a driver I never requested. I was already in vehicle with a driver who was completely confused because the requested Pool had him pick up 2 people from same location. I send Uber a message explaining this and they issue me a $5 credit to account. NO, I want a $5 credit back to my bank account! It may seem petty to some but I control my funds not Uber or anyone else. I explain to them I want refund to my account and their response that in accordance with their cancellation policy it can only be credited to my account, I've looked at the site and there is nothing that visibly shows cancellations are only credited to accounts. And if I'd known about this policy I would've discontinued use with Uber long time ago. 
The fact that a random driver can issue a cancellation and Uber automatically charges me is such a huge problem. I am officially a Lyft customer, I will dispute this with my bank and my complaints are with ConsumerAffairs, BBB and Attorney General. I have no idea who this driver is and this couldn't be possible when I was already waiting for Uber pool.

Me and the birthday girl my best friend and one of her friends went out to celebrate her birthday. The plan was we all pitch in for a ride there and back and since we all lived in the same direction we would just have the driver drop us off individually until he reach his destination. (Which we normally do with no problems) We dropped off the birthday girl 1st and then 5 blocks away it would be my turn, but this driver refuse to turn into my parking lot which left me no choice but to just have stop in the middle of the street to let me out. As I got out in a hurry I dropped my keys in his Van. I had my friend contact the third girl but she was too drunk to pick up.
The next day I contacted the 3rd girl to get the drivers information and have her fill out a lost item report to have the driver call me back, since it was her credit card that was used for the trip. I waited 24 hours and no one called me back. I had my Acquaintance fill out another report and waited another 24 hours but no callback. I then took matters in my own hands to reach out to the support group, but they refused to help me since it was not my card that was used. They wanted me to contact my acquaintance and have her fill out a report and she would then have to deal with them.
Seeing that this was my problem and hers I did not want to burden her with more of my problems. I just come to the conclusion that I will not be seeing my keys anytime soon. I wish there is a better way for the other passengers in the Uber to obtain their lost Item without involving the cardholder and making it such a difficult process. I was also very disappointed that the uber driver made me jumped out of the car in the middle of the road after I had had a few drinks and that he never called me back. Or the uber support group for not even trying to help me when I clearly had the driver’s information!

Let's be honest, who would mind paying couple $$ for a ride and relax in the back set listening to music and not dealing with traffic, especially here in LA. But Uber won't let you enjoy this convenience as much especially recently when they changed some of their policies. Here is an example, it is late at night, you just had fun in your friend's house and it is time to request Uber to take you home. You request Uber. Wait outside for the driver. In this phase, ETA become slow. 8 minutes waiting.
And two of the scenario will occur. 1- They show you that the driver is still far so you would think, ""yes let me cancel and find someone closer"" and even Uber will ask you why you had canceled and one of their reason is ""too far"" eventually. You got charged for 5$. 2- Maybe the driver is close but he would rather to cancel the ride and take ** without going all the way to pick you up. Let's say none of these situation happened. Here is how Uber would find a way to increase their charges. ""Based on the time and distance I could confirm you that this is the fare for this ride"". Uber POOL shows me 7$, after the ride 23$. Uber, to increase your revenue. Increase your profession.

I have been using Uber for many years (especially as a consultant, I used them weekly for my work travel to/from airports) but was disgusted with the way the company treated me as a customer. On 4/13, I requested a pickup from LGA, Terminal C, Pickup area 1. I attempted to call the driver 5 times to let him know my exact location at Terminal C pickup area but got his voicemail each time. I waited over 15 mins just to see him drive past the requested pickup area and continue to drive through all of Terminal C (as I was trying to chase him down) without slowing down or attempting to pull into any of the subsequent pickup areas to look for me. 
This driver also did not attempt to contact me and proceeded to cancel my ride and charge me a $5 cancellation fee. I notified Uber of the situation and they refused to refund me my cancellation fee (would only provide an Uber credit) because it was ""not in accordance with our policy"". The fee is not the issue I had, it was the principle that I was charged for the fee. At no point was this my fault for the cancellation - the driver drove past me and did not even attempt to pick me up! After multiple attempts to contact Uber, they stopped responding to my messages. Uber is so petty that they would rather charge a fee than respect a customer who has been using their service for years.

Be alert for selecting UberPool for a reduced fare but being charged UberX or Economy at double the fare. When attempting to resolve, the company will state things such as 'we've adjusted a fare in the past for you' coupled with 'your fare is correct,' finally with a conclusion of 'your driver selected the trip in good faith.' I have been an Uber passenger on many occasions and never had a fare adjusted. My fare was absolutely incorrect and my driver selecting my trip is great, however, I wish to not pay a much higher fare for a type of ride I did not select.

Concept of Uber is great. Try finding customer service is the pits. Once you contact them via messaging you will find that if you have an ongoing conversation, replies their system is set up to tag next available service rep. Meaning every time you send in your reply, a new service rep has to review all the conversations to get the rest of the customer’s problem. Extremely time consuming on both parts. My wife is presently texting them as I write. I'm not a patient man and have spent two three days going back and forth on a relatively simple question.

I did one trip last month with Uber. But still I didn't get paid for it. I contacted with them. They all are liar. The day I did the trip same day I e-mail to them. They said “you will see in your partner dashboard.” But didn't show up. Then I e-mail again. They said 48 hours. After 48 hours I e-mail again. Now they are asking for information again. I said “how many times I've to give you information.” Then they ask for trip no. I said “the day I did the job from that time it's totally vanished so how I'm gonna give you trip no. Only I can give you passenger name, approximate time, pick up address and destination” and I gave it to them. Then they said again 48 hours.
After 48 hours I e-mail again, “are you guys playing with me? Just tell me are you gonna pay or not, I had enough.” Then they said it solved but after that trip which I already got it. Then I said “before this trip I did one. I'm talking about that one.” Again they said 48 hours. Then I e-mail again and said, “today is 11th day still you guys didn't pay.” Then they answer me “after 10 days we can't do anything.” Before they didn't pay me some trips but I didn't care because those are short trip but this one I went to NJ with traffic and tolls. That’s why I won't let it go so easily. I spend lot of times. Then I said “from now on I'm not gonna work anymore. You guys are cheating with driver harder money.”

Just recently signed up. First time was good $10. Second time same route from work $25. I contacted they gave a refund. For the next Five rides to and from work no problem. On the sixth ride I got to location which was very short. Requested a ride. On walking out the door, I notice driver was still there, he told me cancel and Re-request and he'll get it, but while I tried to do that I got a message saying disabled account. And keep getting the run around with having sufficient credit balance in Uber gift credit and now I don't have a ride.
Used up all my money on purchasing Uber gift credit and no one from Uber is assisting, keep saying they reactivate the account but haven't and I still can't used my already existing credit balance in the sum of almost a $100. No resolve for four days. It's frustrating, taxi company cannot do this kinda of stuff. Neither should Uber be able to treat customers without regards, and should have a Phone Contact (1800) for issues like this. This is unacceptable and shouldn't be allowed. They are stealing and nothing is being done. The law should get involved and protect consumers from these unprofessional people. I need A resolve about my valued credit that I can't use. Wrong Wrong!

Visited Orlando Florida and used Uber twice to return from Universal Studio. The first day I was charged 15.88 and the second trip cost 9.34. When I questioned the first driver about the route we were taking he advised he missed his exit causing him to take the next exit which was completely out of the way. The second driver took the direct route with no problem. When I questioned Uber customer service they explained how algorithms work and found no fault with the fare. I received my receipt and noticed the total should have been 12.84. They did refund the $3 difference but refused to acknowledge the difference in price between the first and second driver even though it was entirely driver error. After researching this seem to be a somewhat common practice. Will use Lyft in the future."

I used Uber regularly as well as UberEATS. I loved the convenience! Once... Today I had a meeting across town. When it was over I requested an Uber pool for the cheap price and I had two hours before my next appointment. I'm thinking, ""shouldn't take more than an hour"". I was WRONG! The driver that picked my ride drove past me a minimum of 3x. I saw this on the little gps the app provides. The driver eventually started heading to the OTHER side of town! I tried calling twice to make sure he wasn't lost but he forwarded me to his VM both times and never reached out to me. Eventually, he heads away from my location and the ETA becomes even longer. 
I tried to cancel to get another driver, but the app charged me $5 to do so. Scared I would just get another ** driver, I contacted Customer service and they say this is a legitimate charge because the driver accepted my ride and it doesn't matter where in town he was or the new ETA after driving past me, only that he took the time to accept the ride. They choose to take $5 over a loyal customer. Choose Lyft, a taxi, bus or hitchhike before trusting these money hungry scammers.

I recently had THREE Uber rides charged to my credit card, charges which my bank originally refused. When I complained to Uber via e-mail, I got a series of potted replies, with them eventually asserting that ""they believed the charges were legitimate."" Only after having the charges reversed with my bank and contacting Uber a fifteenth time did I get the explanation that my credit card details must have been acquired OUTSIDE Uber and then linked to an Uber account. This is NOT a very convincing explanation. 
When the first charge was made to my credit card, my bank supposedly refused it and blocked further charges. For some reason, though, Uber continued to honour my card for additional rides and then blocked me from using their service because of unpaid previous rides. Also, no charges were made to my credit card other than by Uber. And finally, the charges were set up on my credit card as RECURRING charges. How is this even possible WITHOUT some kind of manipulation of the Uber payment system itself? For these reasons, I suspect there is a serious security breach within Uber that they are unwilling to admit.

I have had an ongoing complaint with Uber and it has finally hit the boiling point. I have been taking Uber quite faithfully twice a day for several months now and my pick up and drop off locations have never changed however Uber consistently changes the one address every time. I was OK with that since I was still getting where I needed to be until they started changing the quoted fees as well. When I called them out on it they would say that they had checked and that the information they had was correct. I have emailed them copies of the address plaque on the building where they are picking me up and they are still insisting that I am being picked up at a different address and that it is a longer ride and therefore a higher fare. The address they are insisting is wrong. Is the address for the commuter train station! The really irritating part is that the place that they are insisting I am being picked up at is the building where they house the trains!!
The line I keep getting when asking them to correct the price to what I was quoted is that ""The quote is based on the information that the passenger has put into the app and if that information is incorrect then the revised fare will be charged."" I would think when I have photographic proof that the information I am putting into the app is correct that they wouldn't have a problem correcting the fee that they are charging to the fee quoted, but they instead keep telling me that the information I put in was incorrect! I am fed up with Uber and am considering switching to Lyft since they are now in my area. I would rather pay a higher fee to someone who is quoting me the higher fee right off the bat and not using a ""bait and switch"" technique to change the fee than to pay it because of the ""bait and switch"".

It has happened to me 2 times in a row that I had scheduled a ride and the drivers never showed up. I travel on regular basis and I schedule a ride a night before to the airport thinking I will be on time because of Uber. I missed my flight 2 times and never got refunded for my plane fare. I sent an email stating my complaint. The first time they never got back to me which was on March 19th 2017 6 in the morning. Same thing happened today. Also I had a flight to catch.
1- The first driver never showed up. Called me stating that he is late 15 mins away Instead of 1 min. I missed my flight to the airport. When I asked him that I scheduled a ride a night before he stated that IT'S NOT HIS job to be there on time and told me to called a nearest driver, same thing Happened again. I trust Uber again because I didn't have a choice and they didn't show up again. The driver's name was Syed.
2- The second driver that I had scheduled a ride with today was also very unprofessional and rude. Called me, he was supposed to be here 1 min ago and it's been half an hour and still not here. He stated that he missed an exit and won't be able to make it. What the hell is this? I don't trust Uber services now. Will never book again with them. Well they can care less because they have a lot of business because it's an app based business. Their service should be good but they seem like a fraud. If they charge me a 5 dollar fee how many other people they are charging and making thousands of money off of everyone and NOT REFUNDING. What do I do at this point. This is a FRAUD. Drivers are canceling by themselves and charging fees.
Lastly Uber is not reliable at all because they are making so much money. They don't care about their customers. I submitted a complaint last time. No one responded me. Don't have any number that you can call. They are just app based and have a horrible service! Driver name was NABIN driving TOYOTA VENZA plate **. Don't trust this driver. Charged me money and never gave it back. Very upset about this situation. Someone NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION ON THIS.

I live in SF and I will NOT use Uber (and Lyft) anymore because of rude driver behavior. I have found too many of the drivers, from those companies, don't follow basic courtesy of at least pulling off the road for a pickup or drop off. And I mean with a curb space a mere 2 feet away. In fact I saw a driver pick up a passenger in the middle of an intersection (granted it was a 3 way intersection). He block the traffic as is so often the case. Both companies need to list to their customer that the driver will stop at the closest parking or off road location. And drivers need to pull OFF the roadway."

You can never call Uber and talk to somebody, it sounds like to be that the whole thing is software and machine controlled. 4. If you by any chance cancel your ride they will charge you... 5.

Then while I complained to customer care, next day they told they adjusted the fare to 54 and rest 148 will be refunded back in 3 days, and again deducted 54 Rs. from Paytm on 23rd March in the morning 7:53 am (I did not take any ride).

Uber will lose the race to Ola eventually. The negative news they find themself surrounded in will soon bring it down. I did not give much to those negative news until I recently (28th March 2017) witnessed their lack of customer care. The Uber cab was requested to reach Ramaiah Hospital at 3.00 pm. He did, but he refused to pick up my aunt who was on wheelchair. She was released from hospital after full recovery but aged 91, we did not want her to walk. He zoomed away in style. What did that moron expect when a customer calls from a hospital. We called the reliable trustworthy Ola and reached home sound and safe.

Had difficulty figuring out the app on my Phone and as a result had to cancel the trip as soon as I entered it, the address I had entered for home and the place I was going came up wrong. I did not notice this until I booked the ride. Soon as I realized the error I canceled the trip. I actually had this error several time and canceled my ride. I made several other errors in trying to schedule a future pickup time and had to cancel the ride again. 
When I finally figured the App out and tried to reschedule a ride, I got this message. ""ERROR. Too many cancellations. Please retry requesting later."" When I messaged UBER again they kept asking me to send a screenshot from my phone (I could not do this) showing the error message. I sent them the actual error message. After several emails, they finally said I was reinstated. That wasn't true. I kept getting the same message.

I checked my bank account the next day and to my surprise Uber had charged me $34.50 going to Nashville and $15 coming back. When I inquired about this I was basically given the runaround telling me that I put in a different address than where we went. Once I showed them the Google mileage and the receipt that I printed out from Uber showing that I put in the correct address, now they have changed it to ""It was a demanding night, so the fares went up.""

I have been using Uber for a couple of years now. I use UberPool at least once a week. I recently requested a ride home from babysitting and was pretty upset when I was charged more than what I agreed to and that they wouldn't honor the initial price. The price I was told was $5.83, but when I got home I saw that it was $11.12. The driver did miss the exit and add more time and distance, so I figured that once I explain this to customer service that they would refund me the difference as this was not my fault. I hope that the driver didn't do this intentionally. They did not, and are standing by what they charged me.

Requested a pickup in Seattle at 4:25PM on March 23rd and the request was accepted with a 7 minute ETA. I placed the pin exactly where I was standing in a very visible spot on a sidewalk that was easy to access. Watched the driver drive all around me on the Uber app but never coming closer than 3 or 4 blocks. After 30 minutes of this a message popped apologizing for the inconvenience, but the DRIVER cancelled, which now made me late for my dinner reservation. Adding insult to injury, I also saw that they charged me a $5 cancellation fee. I immediately disputed this and after many exchanges where I explained what happened and also pointed out that the driver far exceeded 5 minutes past the 7 minute ETA which entitled ME to cancel per THEIR OWN POLICY, the most they would do is ""promise"" a $5 credit on a future ride.
Everyone needs to understand that when they use Uber, you pay upfront with no guarantee that they will show up, and if THEY don't, the driver will claim that you were not at your pickup point and you will still be charged a fee. It seems to me that this problem could easily be eliminated by requiring the rider to provide the driver with a random authorization code that was provided by the rider's Uber app in order for them to get paid. They could also avoid missing rider disputes by simply matching the driver's cancellation like caution to the rider's pickup location. If the locations are not in close proximity, in my case he was 4 blocks away, then they know that the DRIVER is the one that improperly cancelled and no fee should be charged. I do not recommend that anyone should use this service without understanding that you may not get picked up and you will still be charged.

Last Monday 03-13 I called Uber for a ride from Pomona Ca. to Ontario Ca. Airport. I got a contact and it showed approx. $18 dollars. All of a sudden the page went blank. I called Uber again requesting Uber again and the charge came up as $38.00 and gave a name of the driver and he was less than 10 minutes away. So I am in the parking lot of the business with my luggage, when he drove in. I waved to let him know I was the one. I am sure he saw me he was within 50-75 ft. away. Without hesitation he did a hard 180 degrees and sped out of the parking lot and was gone, without a word. I was a bit aggravated, So I dialed up Uber again. To the same pickup and same delivery points.
Now the fare had jumped to $64. And change. I wasn't sure what was happening, but I had to have a ride to the Airport, thinking it was a mistake and they would get it right back to the original fare. The 3rd. Driver called me and he said he had a passenger with him and would that be ok. I said yes. He was again less than 10 minutes away. I watched him on my phone as he wandered around. Got down to 1 minute and then he missed the turn and it went to 7 minutes. Well this happened several more times, I called him to tell him where to turn and he said his GPS was messed up. No doubt!! I watched him drive by the address I had given him 3 times.
I called him again. Told him to turn around and come back. This took almost an hour for him to get to me. He told me his GPS was not working correctly again. I asked did he know how to get to the Airport... ""Yes"". We didn't go a quarter of a mile and he turned off the road into a Dead in Street. So we had to turn around and start all over again. I pulled out my phone and we used my phone GPS to get us to the Airport. Now Uber has charged me a Surge Fee, whatever that is of 2.9x the original fare. I contacted them thru the only way possible FB and they finally agreed to take $15 off the overcharge. None of this was my fault, and I want the original fare, as to what I owe them. I have contacted my Credit card company and filed a complaint to contest the overcharge. I on this one trip out west used Uber 6 times. I just signed up for Lyft.

I have been an avid Uber rider for quite a while. But recently, they've been in the business of disabling rider accounts for NO APPARENT REASON.

Well I pay all of my fares so there's no reason for my account to be disabled. Today was the last straw. I requested a ride to work, which of course needed to be in a timely manner. The driver was initially around 5 minutes away. But 5 turned in to 10 minutes, which turned into 15 minutes. 
I had no choice but to cancel and I WAS CHARGED A CANCELLATION FEE?? I WAS CHARGED FOR THEIR DRIVER BEING INCOMPETENT. They REFUSED to refund my money even though they so clearly stole it from me.

I have been a loyal customer of Uber. I cannot even get a hold of anyone. The drivers have been great. However their charging system is unprofessional and unreliable. I am going to have to report lost or stolen due to them. They do surcharges which flash so fast you don't even get a chance to see their charges. They also start charging you for rides that you do not even take or had even requested or even authorized. This is how they get your money and scam you. I wouldn't trust Uber unless it is a once in awhile type of thing, because when you are a continuous customer they drain your account and if you don't watch it closely you could be overdrawn with many fees.

I requested a trip using UberPool. I have been using it daily to the same location. Today, when I received an Uber receipt, my daily charge of $2.99, was higher, $8.18. I used their app to dispute the charge, but receive a crazy response stating that I was charged correctly. They are liars and too lazy to even research the issues. Looking at the map on the app, the driver drove to my location, then continued on. No one else was in the car with me. He should have ended the call when I reached my location.
Has Uber gotten so large that their quality of customer service has diminished? They need to monitor their drivers better. If they would have actually researched my issue, I am sure that they would have records of the requested destination that I entered, when I was picked up. The app has GPS. It's also on the map that we went to location that I requested. I don't understand, why I've been charged for going to an address that I did not go to, nor did I request to go to that location. Uber needs to do right by their customers. A few drivers are diminishing the quality of their services. They need to realize that they're not the only company in the game. I'm already researching alternative means. I am also disputing the overcharged amount through my bank.

They are crazy and basically called me a liar. Why would I order another cab if I was lying and they refuse to credit my card... So now I had to cancel my card. I will never ever, ever use their service again. They even put in my wrong address. They are crooks. Imagine how many people they get this way... It's disgusting."

I used Uber to go to a stressful dr's appointment and wish I would have driven myself if I could have. The vehicle was a mess, it smelled awful and the leather seats were sticky. (I was afraid to ask why.) It was a bad trip anyway because the place I was going is very traffic busy. The driver swerved in and out of traffic, and at least 10 miles over the speed limit. And very rude."

Figure out how risky it is that UBER can charge right into your credit card whatever they want after the fact!!! One day on the same route, I was charged 3 times as much as with other driver, some UBER driver intentionally took a longer route to get to my destination to charge me more, I did not know until after the trip when I check my emails by end of the day, it was too late and it was very hard to find a right subject to submit a complaint with UBER. Their customer service is horrible: they don't listen to your complaint, they are just using patterns of reply. I WILL NOT USE UBER AGAIN as I think some Uber drivers have a way to rob customers."

I requested an Uber from LA to Pasadena which was quoted at an estimated $22.00. I was charged the full price and my $20 discount for getting Uber a new client through the use of my Referral Promo Code was removed from my account and not honored. I wasn't aware of this until I took my return trip home where I was charged about $5 dollars more. Once again my second $20 discount was removed from my account but was not honored. I was charged the full amount of the trip. 
Additionally, because a driver canceled on me while en route to my location and instructed me to call someone else, Uber charged me a $5 cancellation fee. Uber may have been a promising concept at some point since I've used them many times before, but their customer service has seriously depleted. I used to promote them but now I'm actually doing the opposite and I'm heavily promoting Lyft in my duty as a resort concierge. I speak with thousands of people every month so they really screwed up with this former client, but they're rich and according to recent news, Uber boss is an abusive sexist creep who's facing potential lawsuits from his former employees. I hope Lyft becomes the dominating service. I'm definitely going to help them.

Uber has been gradually allowing drivers with poor reviews to work for them. I have had safety issues and even a driver who was clearly under the influence, among other safety issues Re: Uber drivers. When I've canceled a ride due to low review scoring by other passengers, they have charged me cancellation fees and refused to refund me the $2. This happened three times in a row where I cancelled those trips within less than 24 hours.
Lyft allows me to cancel trips if I do not feel safe riding with a driver with a poor review score and has now configured me to ride with drivers with a 4.6 score or above, as I've encountered safety issues with their drivers. I will try Lyft, Cabify, Juno or Via before choosing Uber as I am sure other companies will continue to come into the market and provide much better services to compete with Uber.

I set up an appointment for a ride on March 4th for a pickup at my location to a ride to my doctor at 160 Kimel Forest Park Drive. Pickup window was 9:45 to 10 a.m. The driver no call no showed me. So after I realized he was not coming like I found another Uber driver that could take me to my dr. appointment. Well unfortunately by the time we got there I was already past my appointment time seven minutes or so so they would not honor my appointment. They told me I had to pay a rescheduling fee because I didn't cancel my appointment within 24 hours. Well there would have been no reason to cancel the appointment if the original Uber driver was on time to take me to my doctor. So once I found out from my doctor after I paid my fee, I meet Lee, called Uber back for a pickup from 140 Kimel Forest Park Drive back to my Residence at **. 
You can check the records this driver that was originally supposed to pick me up was very unreliable and very unprofessional by not picking up the phone and calling me or notifying me that he wasn't going to be able to make it. At that point I could have gotten another driver that could have got me there on time but he refused to do it. So once I realized he was going to be too late I called for another driver. He got me there a little bit after 10:30 when my appointment was scheduled and I was notified I had to pay a rescheduling fee which I did and reschedule an appointment too immediately. At that time I searched for another Uber driver that could take me home. He pick me up from 164 Kimel Forest Park Drive, took me to my Residence at **. Both the drivers that took me there and brought me home were extremely professional, courteous and a pleasure to ride with. 
My problem is the original driver who had my original pick up with my time call window from 9:45 to 10. By him not showing up I not only paid for a ride to and from my doctor for no reason because I had no appointment due to the driver being late then I had to pay a rescheduling fee to my doctor which is totally unacceptable. This was my first time as an Uber customer and that's not a really good way to start a business relationship so I would appreciate it if you could help me to rectify the situation.

On Feb 14th night I was boarding an Uber cab that my daughter booked, when the driver started without checking if I got in or door was closed. Result was that my right foot came under the wheel of the car. I had to shout at him to stop. I asked him to reverse the car and it took him a good five minutes before he inched back a bit. I told him to reverse more as my foot was still stuck. Passers-by had to yell at him before he decided to move back. The pain was unbearable. I did not go to the hospital then as the insurance was left back in my daughters apartment.
I decided to return to India and then go to the hospital due to the language barrier in France where comprehending English is a challenge. I didn't want a wrong diagnosis. I have ended up with ligament tear in my right ankle which will take very long to heal. I submitted the hospital report to Uber and told them that they had to compensate for the injury. I wrote to uber support and Natasha called me today and asked if I had had insurance when I was in Paris. I told her instead of asking me to claim insurance, Uber should actually pay compensation for the injury and unwarranted pain caused due to the negligence of the uber driver on duty. I was shocked when she responded that Uber is not responsible for anything that happens to a customer when they are on a ride and I should take this up with the company that the driver works with.
This is not only ridiculous but a shame that an established company like Uber is washing of responsibility and leaving it to me the affected passenger to sort out with a third party. The cab was booked with uber and saying that uber is not responsible is a disgrace and speaks volumes of the lack of business ethics that Uber demonstrates. I wrote to Travis Kalanick and even tweeted on his post but no response.

This is my first experience using Uber. I called for a ride and was given a price ($11.00). I accepted the ride and was overall happy with the prompt pick up and driver. Later that month I reviewed my charge card and noticed I was billed again by Uber the next day for an additional $13.00. When I emailed and complained the answer was the driver was unable to calculate the price correctly. I cannot believe Uber can charge my card without my consent! The fact the driver made a mistake is not my problem and the agreed cost should not be altered.
This was my first time using Uber. Later I was told I should have been given a discount up to $20 as a new customer. Uber is standing behind the additional charge. This is the worst customer service! I can't believe Uber thinks it's ok to charge my card after the ride. Can you imagine if all store charges could add on an additional cost for whatever reason they wanted! This is not right. The driver should eat the cost and learn by his mistake.

I then saw that he was just sitting, not moving anymore. I texted him again and he still did not respond. After a while I cancelled the ride and re-order a new ride, who got to me in 3 minutes.
I was at a Target parking lot, it was cold and 9:30pm. By the time the new driver came and got me home it was almost 10:30pm. I was charged $5.00 for the ride that I cancelled and when I contacted Uber about it, they said they do that. So, if your driver has his phone off and cannot find you, they will still charge you even though you waited, called and texted the driver and he does not respond. You're stuck with a charge. I feel that they should reprimand the driver and let him take that loss, not charge you for setting up a better driver.

Uber is one of the most shady unethical companies ever created. I stopped driving for them over a year ago, but decided to try UberEats as a delivery person. I figured it would be better because I wouldn't have to drive people - boy was I wrong. First, they take 35% of every delivery. Then they don't have enough delivery drivers so I noticed I was driving 15 to 20 mins to reach a restaurant (which you are not compensated for), to pick up an order that is being delivered to a location that may be 2 to 3 mins away. Giving the driver a whopping $2.86 for that delivery. I have also gone to pick up orders only to arrive at the restaurant, to find out the order was cancelled and Uber doesn't compensate the driver with a cancellation fee. The order still showed active in my app, but nobody took the time to notify me.
After this, I stopped accepting requests that were more than 8 mins away. So, if an order was cancelled, I wouldn't lose anything. So guess what Uber did, they started manipulating the travel time to the restaurants, often times changing it to 1 min away. So when I received the request, instead of it showing the actual 12 mins away, it only showed 1 min. So, you accept the request, and hit navigation and the GPS shows the actual time, and in some cases the restaurants were 12 mins away or more. It didn't work though, because I only deliver in areas that I know really well, so I was well aware that there were no restaurants that close to my location. At first, I thought something was wrong with the app, but Uber never responded, when I asked them why they were manipulating the pickups.
Then, there's instant pay. Uber offers the drivers the option to cash out daily using instant pay. Sound like a winner, right? Wrong. Instant pay doesn't work most of the time. There have been several times that I needed emergency money for bills etc. So I would go out and deliver hit the instant pay button and guess what. I've worked 10 hours and I can't get my money. I contact support, which means this will never be resolved and Uber doesn't give a **. I received 15 different reasons from 15 different support reps as to why I couldn't get my money. Uber says keep driving and check back in about a week or 10 days. It should be resolved by then. They charged me for a flimsy delivery bag that I never asked for. I had been delivering for about 3 weeks, when I received something in the mail. I set it aside and never opened it.
So a few days later, I was checking my earnings, and I noticed $6.50 was missing. Contacted support to see where my money was, and they told me it was for the delivery bag that I never ordered or asked for. I told them I would like to return it for a refund, because I didn't order it and I didn't open it. Next thing I know, they're like, ""You can keep the bag, and we will give you a refund."" A few days later, I noticed Uber sent an email to me, offering me $10, if I would give them my pay statements from Lyft. When I didn't answer, they sent another email offering me $20. No thanks Uber. That's my private information. I will keep it to myself.
Uber lies all of the time, not only to the drivers about earnings, but also to the riders, because they really don't do thorough background checks on their drivers. Nor do they do any research on the restaurants they use for UberEats. A lot of those restaurants I have picked up orders from, have very low health scores. Most are low 80s and high 70s and that's not good at all. They don't have any concern for anyone. They only care about their bottom line. If you deliver for them, make sure you only accept orders that are in close proximity, otherwise you will lose money. Keep in mind, that a court ruled that Uber cannot penalize you for not accepting orders, only for accepting and cancelling them.
Well, a few days ago, I needed emergency money again, so I turned on my app and I started my deliveries. I reached my goal, and I hit the button to cash out, but never received my money. I contacted support and was literally blown off. They made no effort to help me at all. I ended up having to borrow money from my mom. The final straw for me was when I attended the Uber q & a, and when the Uber employees were answering some of the questions, they were laughing and being very unprofessional. They were responding to the drivers like they were dumb.
I went through all of this in less than 8 weeks as an UberEats delivery driver. I didn't just delete the app. I sent in a request to permanently delete my account. When I sent the delete request, that's when I received a generic response, from Uber, asking, what can they do to help. Well, it's a day late and in my case $180 short. I can't support a company who doesn't care about anyone. If you use this service as a rider, or driver, make sure you pay attention to your money.

How do they keep getting away with things. I use Uber everyday multiple times a day. I've had drivers blow stop signs and drive recklessly etc. I needed an Uber the other night so I used my app and I was connected to Mohammed. He immediately calls me to tell me he is over 20 min. away even though my app which has always been accurate said he is 12 min. away. I told him I would wait. 30 min. later since he obviously took his sweet ** time he pulls up more than halfway up the block. I walk towards him and as I'm about to open the door on the driver's passenger side he drives off. He actually could've hit me and hurt me. I called him repeatedly with no answer. He then pulls up on the other end of the block on a main road. As I speed walk towards him waving my arms he drove off again. I then saw him drive by again and drive around the neighborhood and park around the block from me as you can see it on the app. I called him but nothing. 
He then cancels the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I wrote to Uber because this driver is clearly reckless and their emails are generic and no one really reads anything. They refund the money thinking that that's what my concern is. The emails go back and forth to finally get someone with the name of Lia who was extremely rude and said I didn't have to get a refund because the company didn't need to give me one and we would not meet eye to eye and the case is closed.

First, I want to say, I've used Ubers for a few months and NEVER had a problem. Wanted to write what happened and let others know Uber is great! A friend always used Uber in Phila. I had no idea what it was. I recently moved to Florida - took a trip back home to Phila. via Tampa airport. The cost for an Uber to airport was $27 and I gave a tip. On my way back from the Tampa airport, I would also use an UBER. WRONG! Again, NO IDEA that Ubers were not allowed near the Airport. After my flight got in LATE evening, I got online to summon an Uber... the site would not pull up. I tried again and again to no avail.
Now I was worried and submitted to using a Taxi. I walked over to a few sitting on the side and asked if they were available. They stated yes and where would I like to go? I told them Treasure Island and they told me at LEAST $75. WHAT?!? I said, ""Ubers only charge $27 and I couldn't not get them online. He said, ""You won't - they are NOT allowed here!"" So... the taxi's can rob people. Taxi's don't want Ubers so they can rob people - especially in need... which I was. BUT, I just took a taxi over the bridge and had a friend pick me up. Guess what? I was in the taxi 5 minutes and was charge $36. That's such BS. I got over the bridge - instead of calling my friend... I called an Uber and STILL got home cheaper. Taxi drivers and legal thieves.

Be careful as Uber is getting sloppy with overcharges, not providing credits, and charging Cancellation fees when it was not me who canceled. This All happened within the last week. Uber was late in arrival twice in the last week. They sent me a text message each time stating they would credit the next fare. It was only $1.99 for each ride. I never keep the text messages as I don't remember having this sort of problem. I ride quite a bit so I didn't think anything of the credits until the a couple days after the 2nd ride.
I've messaged Uber several times. They want me to provide dates, times, and the text message. I provided the dates and times yet they still ask me for them. I'm flabbergasted they do not have the text messages when it comes to credits. Still working on it. Funny how they want me to provide proof when all they have to do is look at the receipt. Their Customer Service regarding this issue has been a complete joke. Another time they Overcharged me by about $5. If I didn't look at the receipt then they would have screwed me on an overcharge. A driver canceled the ride on me last night and Uber charged me the $5 cancellation fee. I'm still waiting on a response. Now I have to review every charge.

We all know Uber is lousy (try Lyft instead), but here's another example: Arriving at the Fort Lauderdale airport, tried to do an Uber. It was accepted by the driver, then they called and cancelled saying it was too early for them. They told me to go to the app and cancel it myself (I assume so they could charge me and not get in trouble for cancelling a ride). This happened a second time with a different driver exactly the same. Then finally the 3rd one arrived. Uber didn't charge my credit card for the 2 cancelled fees, instead they charged it for the entire amount of the 2 rides I didn't take and they list it on their site as a cancelled, so if I wasn't paying close attention to my credit card transactions, it would have gone unnoticed. 
There is no way to contact Uber support either. When you call they tell you to send an email to support@uber.com. Then when you send an email to that address, it comes back as an address that doesn't get monitored or read! Uber sucks.

I saw the commercials and needed transportation as I am disabled and my knees and legs are also weakened. I opened a Uber account, added a promo code, and thought I was set for my first trip, wrong! I was refused pick up 5 times and was stranded. I tried walking but my legs gave way and fell on the side of the road, a stranger helped me and gave me a ride home. I contacted the company and they stated the account problem is fine on next ride. I was dropped off by a family member before his work, then called Uber again, and again I was refused a ride so I had to pay 25.00 out of pocket as I had my granddaughter which had to be dropped off home then myself.
I contacted uber again and they said I must have a credit, debit, Paypal, android, etc. or other form of payment. I explained I did not have these and two reps had confirmed I could just use the gift cards. I requested a refund of the gift card, Uber refused stating, ""Either give us a credit card or no services and we will not give you a refund."" So I sit here with swollen knees, out of 50.00. It was a bad experience for me as now I need a doctor's appointment.

I purchased a flat fare package in NYC and could use it in all 5 boroughs for $2.99 Uber pool or $5.99 Uberx the fare has to be below $30. I take an Uber pool that clearly quoted $2.99(I have a screenshot) and was charged $41.00. I contacted Uber customer service which sucks and was told the driver had an issue which prevented this trip from being timed according to proper pick up and drop off.

Supposedly Uber is meant to be cashless per their response below, unless you got my driver ""**"", The ride from Boca TOOJAY's Deli on Glades Rd to WPB started with a stop at a gas station where the driver complained the cost to pay cash vs credit card was $.25 more per gallon... The ride then went well until we arrived in WPB where the drive said ""I"" do not that credit cards when I offered him my card. This was fine, as I always carry cash. I asked how much, he said like, like $42 to which I said fine. I handed the driver $60 and asked for $10 back. He said he did not have a $10 and offered me a few ones....
I then went in my house and grabbed $10 (a 5 & 5 1s) which I gave him. I then get an electronic receipt on my iPhone showing a $33.12 receipt... The receipt is attached. I can only tell you as a first time Uber customer, I was defrauded and while not a money issue, I plan to have individuals on my staff seek YOU'RE doing the right thing on this.
Response from Uber was: Thanks for letting us know, Greg. As a reminder, the Uber experience is meant to be cashless. We are happy to review your trips and make necessary adjustments to fares if you let us know about issues that arise.

My Uber ride from my home to Wal-Mart was enjoyable. I paid $7.80. After shopping, I turned on the Uber app to request a ride. Everything was normal until the moment I pressed ""request ride"". The app moved to view the airport and asked me to select my location. I backed out and tried again, and the app still insisted that I select a location within the airport. Funny thing... There was a blue dot on my REAL PICK up location, but the app was not allowing me to click on the blue dot. When I manually entered my location, it still swung back to the airport!!! I had my 2 yr old with me and had no choice to agree to the ridiculous overcharging. When I brought this to Uber's attention, I was dismissed and they gave me a response of ""It was higher because of the demand for the Uber service""... Yeah... OK!!! Long story, I was ripped off and Uber gives no **. I am NOT using this service ever again."

Two days ago I took a trip with Uber in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. I normally use this service every day. Another passenger with me on the trip forgot their phone in the car. Since then we have sent about 20 messages to Uber Customer service. They finally determined that the driver found the phone but we are still waiting for it to be returned. Uber and the driver now have my direct contact information and yet the only way I can get any feedback is through the Uber Customer Service system. I think that in such cases Uber should make it easier for the driver and customer to communicate directly. I will no longer be using Uber or recommending their services after this incident. We just want our item returned and I no longer trust this service, its reliability or safety rating."

Let me start by saying that I have a disability. My team in my office decide to have lunch at Clyde's in Chinatown. The driver taking me to me to Chinatown, did pick me up in front of our building but want I did not like about him is that he keep trying to invite himself to lunch. The return was a nightmare, I was watching the driver going around in circles. I tried calling him but he did not answer. He finally called me, I could barely understand him. He wanted me to meet him almost a block away. I told him I have and disability and needed him to pick me up in front of Clyde's, he then just cancelled my ride.
I scheduled another ride. Once again I had a person that wanted me to meet him on the corner. I finally just took a taxi back to my office they picked me up in front of Clyde's and dropped me off in front of my office. From now on when I need to travel on DC I'm taking a taxi. By the way, I complained to Uber, all I got was a ""Sorry"". I do not trust their vetting of driver. Oh by the way the driver that cancelled charged me a cancellation fee.

Uber doesn't care for its drivers. So UBER doesn't take any fuel charges for over 2 weeks, then sends a letter explaining how it was their fault and they will correct the problem over two pay periods only take all the fuel charges from me in one pay. And on top of that, riders damage my vehicle and UBER tells me pay $1,000 deductible to file a claim. They overcharge riders on the upfront pricing and takes over 25% of nearly all rides over 2 miles. And it's not fair that driving at night subjects me to being rated by drunk racists who in turn are the deciding factors to whether I am able to continue driving on the platform."

In the last few times I used them they also added a booking fee of $2.50. Unimpressed! In speaking with the drivers, they're not from the area and don't know where they are going. Relying solely on a GPS. One driver didn't even know his bearings, N, S, E, W. That baffled me to no end. As a result of this crappy service, I've cancelled my account with them.

I signed up through a Google ad directly to Uber's website for Orange County drivers in CA which will receive $700 after signing up. No conditions or terms listed. I took pics and video of it because I read so many stories about them trying to cheat people. I inquired after I signed up when I would get my bonus, they then told me it was only $250 for OC drivers. 
I then googled the ad, which was still running, $700 for OC drivers, I took pics and video again, and wrote them that this was false advertising. They then told me they would pay me my full bonus after 75 rides. After 75 rides, they've contacted me saying I will only get $250 and that the link was a SanFran link. I had already sent in evidence that it was an Orange County link. I am only 2 weeks in, I have written my opt out of Arbitration letter, I'm going in, if they don't pay, I'm opting out and joining the lawsuit against them. This is intentional scamming. They were running ads for 700 USD bonus for new drivers in OC only to tell them they only get 250...

We gave him $60 unknowingly that they are paid in advanced over the phone with a secured credit card payment. He knew darn well it must of been a mistake. No way anyone tips $60 for a 10 minute ride.

I've been driving for Uber for a while now and the Uber navigation application is a total disappointment. When you accept a rider request the address for the rider disappears from the application screen leaving you at the mercy of the Uber application which doesn't navigate very well. So you don't have time to enter it in your vehicle GPS application. Then the Uber application routes you to the wrong location and doesn't understand what direction your car is actually going I used both Google maps and Waze applications and had the same issue. The Uber application doesn't interface with either well and has you going in circles quite often. Uber will waste your time and money when you make some. Uber gets a big portion of it in fees. They should have done a better job of development. My car GPS runs circles around Uber's application and has no problems getting me to specific addresses. So what's wrong with Uber's application?"

Well when I sign up with Uber I was looking for some extra income on the side. In the beginning it started pretty slow, but I figured some things out to make decent money using Uber. Like some of the previous reviews the money you make doesn't really cover all of your expenses like gas, car maintenance, etc. For example your total trip fee is 407.80 - Uber fee 103.21 = my actual earnings 304.59 - gas $70 = 234.59 for about 27 online hours. Which comes out to be about 8.69/hr below minimum wage. I put up with it because I needed the money. 
However just recently on 01/20/2017, I pick up three passengers and I had my husband drive for me because I wasn't feeling well. I was also in the vehicle because it is my account, one of the three reported to Uber that my husband was the driver and not me. Uber put my account on hold until a so call investigation is complete. I received an email from Uber about the situation. They said since some else drove beside me that I will be ban from Uber-Partner. 
I email back and said that, ""Why didn't I just get a warning on the first offense instead of a complete ban?"" They said they have zero tolerance on account sharing based of their guidelines/policies and that was it as a Uber Driver. Their customer service sucks, they don't even try to call you for these matters. I told them if I had seen the guidelines beforehand I would have not let my husband drive. I don't believe they even encourage the drivers to read the entire policies before you work for them. Either you are a driver or a rider beware of Uber tactics.

That time, I took the screenshot which shows the request comes from surge sides but no surge appears. I send these information to Uber. Uber still says no and this was not in the surge side and asking me customer's name. I don't save customers name or any information of customers. I said like I know which trip was it and I sent the trip information I have to them. They still says what was the customer's name, trip date or whatever. They don't give my money.
Also, that day, I took a request and I waited 6 mins then I called the customer then she said that ""I cannot come because I lost my keys. Please can you cancel the trip"". I said okay. This happens 2 times. Because of Uber changed the driver screen and no longer I cannot see trips which was canceled by driver. So, I don't have those information too. I told to Uber I have to have 2 cancellation fees. They still says, ""Okay give us customer's name, trip date and time and fare."" Hey, trip even didn't start because customer didn't come:) how can I give you fare information. Also, I don't record customer's name or whatever. If they wanted, they could find which trip was it and how many minutes I waited over there. This is totally weird. From the surge I had to have more $25 and from 2 cancellation fees $3.45+$3.45.

He finally came to the place where we got it and he kept circling the place for five minutes so I called Bewkete and asked him if he needed directions and he told me, ""No. I'll be there later."" So I waited and saw that he left then started going in the opposite direction we were going and went out 5 miles away. So I called him again and he didn't answer. So he texted me back saying, ""I'll talk to you later.""
I was pissed since now we have waited for almost 30 minutes now and it said that he had already picked us up. Even the manager at the counter of the hotel said ""What a jerk for just leaving you there."" So I went to cancel the ride and it said that I would still have to pay for it. So I called another one and it came within 5 minutes and he took me to where I was going. I really don't like that you make me pay for this. You need to hire drivers with better people skills and better skills at finding locations. I guess I'll have to use Lyft since they have better customer service and drivers. It might only cost me 12.10 but to be charged and not even ride is wrong.

I am now writing this review as NOT ONE PERSON AT UBER is assisting me. I have now for 9 weeks not being paid for my ETA's, I am absolutely disappointed. When us as Uber partners don't accept each and every request, it affects our profile, but yet, Uber does not come to the party? Why are ETA's not being paid? Why has Uber not been making efforts to look after their Partners the way the Partners look after Uber?
I have easily submitted about 30-40 emails in the past 8 weeks and all I am getting back are automated computerised responses? I used to submit between 10-25 ETA's per week, but Uber hasn't been paying out the ETA's. If I don't accept each and every trip, I get penalised, but yet, Uber has no interest in their Partners?
I have posted on HelloPeter but clearly UBER has no concern about their reputation in the market, whether negative or positive and I can guarantee you, at the moment, there is not much positive being said about UBER. This is honestly frustrating, disappointing and demotivating. I was told two weeks ago that my issues are being looked into and are being investigated.

On Wednesday 11th January (@ 6:19PM) I booked Uber Cab and Uber app showed waiting time approx 10 mins, in between I then checked my mails for 2-3 mins, and when I opened Uber app again (after 4mins) it showed nothing (means it looked like no cab was booked, and in fact I didn't see booked cab details). I then opened Uber app and booked the cab again (@6:26 PM) and successfully trip completed.
Next day (12th Jan) I got a notification of (50Rs Cancellation Fees - too much frustrating...) and when I checked trips history I got to know that this is a cancellation fee - which I booked yesterday (11th at 6:19PM). But to be honest, I didn't want to cancel that trip(11th Jan @ 6:19PM), in fact Uber App did not show my booked trip details at the same time, that's why I booked Uber cab again at 6:26 PM, so how could I cancel that trip.
In conclusion, you are charging cancellation fees because of your fault only. If Uber app doesn't show booked cab details then how would I cancel that? You know I started using Uber services since last month only, and earlier I used to book OLA cabs, I didn't face this issue in OLA. And one more suggestion to you, Uber app performance is not as good as OLA app. If you trust your customer, then please don't charge that unwanted cancellation fees, because I am not the culprit for that. I sent mail to Uber for all the above concern, but they don't reply because they don't care.

I have been driving with Uber for over three months. I have great reviews from passengers who I have dropped off at many locations all around Orlando. I strongly recommend that no one drives with Uber. They are complete rip off. You will spend more money on gas and put so many miles on your car that you don't even make enough to fill your tank back up and on top of that if there's a rude passenger which Uber does not confirm who the passenger is. They will cause damage to your car and once he reported to Uber they will tell you that he sent it off to an insurance adjuster and I did no longer responsible. Any insurance adjuster will tell you that you have to pay $1000 or more to fix your own car. They don't want to take responsibility for anything and when you sign up for Uber it clearly states that they are responsible for damages caused by passengers.
I do not recommend for anyone to drive with Uber. They are ripping everyone off passengers and driver.

I had my rating at 4.8 with 2500 plus rides and no complaints from Uber for 5 months. I uploaded this video which is on this page created by somebody else. Within few days I received an email from Uber and they wanted to talk over the phone... To my surprise because they never have live person that you can talk. Told the guy that they need to provide me with a lawyer and that they must pay for high tech cameras so I can protect myself while driving for Uber. They said that they will not do anything and following day they shut down my access and couple months later they discontinued my partnership for violating company policy. To this day I don't know what I did and they refused to provide AAPD with all the records... Stating that none can be found."

I started driving with Uber late October 2016. My first week I worked 80 hours, grossed $220., paid $25. Of that in fuel. Put a lot of wear and tear on my brand new Toyota Corolla.

We used Uber to travel 8.2 miles from our hotel to downtown Nashville on New Years Eve. The fare was approximately $15 which was reasonable. When we were ready to leave on New Years Day the Uber app showed because of the high demand our fare increased to 9.7 times. It was raining and there we did not see other choices (taxi's, buses, Lyft) available so I agreed to this. Our bill to go back to our hotel was over $140.00. I received an invoice from our first fare of $15.00 but I never received an invoice from the $140.00 fare. I emailed Uber about the invoice and did not receive a response. Nothing that I read in the Uber app discussed this and I feel this is completely underhanded of Uber to pull this kind of a stunt."

Driving for Uber is depressing and not satisfying. I would say 20% to 30% of people are completely irrational and have unrealistic expectations. Driving rich, hollow, and entitled people in my car is not a joy. After making a small comment to a rider about living on a hill I was asked to turn up the radio immediately. I laughed at how rude the exchange was. I picked up a lady from a BMW dealership. She told me the dealership booked her a ride. She immediately told me she was not pleased with the car, that she likes nice cars even though the car is clean 2015 Honda Civic.
The hours put into tolerating passengers, wasting gas, and depreciating your car's value is challenging. Many customers cancel even though you can drive to the destination and receive no compensation for the ride. Handing out candies and providing phone plugs for people in a minimum wage job is a bit excessive almost akin to sexual favors at a fast food restaurant. Basically, once the customer is in your car you have to absorb whatever excrement they spew to support their delicate ego. I would not advise anyone to do this job. The pay is ridiculous. Driving people around for 3 dollars here and 4 dollars here is thievery.

First there is no customer service. Everything is done by email - whenever they answer those yes once after 30 or more of mine. So I get down Hayward coming from Richmond CA. I get my appointment. I had was 400 p/m when call the appointment center they put me down for 200 on so I had call them to correct them on that so I get because I couldn't ask questions until you get how much money do I need to start with. No one has answers so I didn't have enough money to top that it was 415 on still call my name ""Do you know how much longer it will be?"" Said, ""I don't"" so they my time and now when I could ask questions now let go. Today ask how much does it start at. I was told by customer around 120 a week but the appointment center said starts at 80 a week. Wrong again. When could ask a question always wrong answers. Now I talked to a sales person they start at 157 a week. Then told me she has great news. Found one for 137.
I was happier then she shows me the car but car is locked. Go get the key. They can't find the key. ""Is someone going look for the?"" Said, ""No call special locksmith. I said, ""How long will that take?"" She ""You can come back in a few days."" I told, ""This is my second time here."" She's said, ""That's OK most back at least 2 or 3 times."" ""Well could you get another car and match the price?"" Told me if don't want this car for 157 a week she ready to blow me out the door so I ask for the mgr. Well all of a sudden they found the key. Wow that's great. Much of lies.
Then I get insurance for the car they said I would use. No they didn't put o lene holder info so ""Can't you add that?"" A few minutes, ""Reg is now closed come back tomorrow."" ""OK so tomorrow I will take the car home?"" ""Yes."" Next day I show then the other mgr said Metro Mile is going out of business. About her lie don't need to go on further. It has already too much to put just keep getting worse over a week have insurance on a car isn't drive I paid for. No has help me resolve.

They are both for driving on a suspended license.
I now have a car payment of 445.08 insurance payment of 126.00. I'm paying 200.00 to the court a total of 771.08 and no job or any means to pay it.

We ordered an Uber Select ride home from the airport (this was not the first time we rode Uber Select). While waiting for the ride, which was 7 minutes away when we ordered it, the driver cancelled for some reason. We had to reorder the ride. And we got the same driver, who did come a few minutes later. The ride home was no problem, but we got a cancellation fee of $10 that showed up on our credit card transactions. 
We got on the app and online to request a refund. The message we got was that we were not charged the cancellation fee; but it still showed up on our credit card account. We call our card company and was given a phone number at Uber to call first. We called and got a message that no human will answer us, and we should email to support@uber.com. We did that and got the an email back that said nobody will answer our email, and we should go to the website; in other words, back to where we were in the first place.

It's nice that Uber can help people to bring where they want to go. But I am not happy much so when they don't give back cancellation fees and trip that never take still. They charge. Some drivers are good but some they are not. Start a trip without being pick up is sucks because they will charge you no matter what.

I started driving for Uber on November 17. I took them up on their offer to rent a car through Enterprise. I have seen the charges on my account where the vehicle is being paid for/deducted out. This past weekend, Uber temporarily deactivated my account because my vehicle registration and insurance ""expired"". I resubmitted my documents several times and only received a generic response about how they were invalid. I had no recourse based on these email responses until the following Monday when the local office opened back up, which prevented me from working the whole weekend. The Greenlight Hub's response was that it's my problem that I couldn't get it fixed over the weekend. 
Today, I received a call from Enterprise saying they have had no payments made on my vehicle's account. So now I'm 86% convinced they have a Wells Fargo-setting-up-fake-accounts-for-commission-type scam going on, because I have a feeling that when I go talk to Enterprise in the morning, Uber is going to throw this all back on me, the driver, who has no control or real access to their flawed system that lacks any real support. I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau.

Then I received a message stating that my password and debit card was invalid. So I reverified everything and even put in my debit card again. That was when the nightmare began! I received an email confirmation that the funds were transferred from my account to my bank account. Assuming it was there (bad on my part), I spent the money, only to come home and find out that Uber did not pay my bank!!! So I messaged them several times, and they have changed their story SIX different times!!! I am very fed up with Uber right now as a driver. I loved to drive, but the customer service and how they treat their drivers when there is a payment issue is unbelievable! I need to know where I can file a complaint against them about this. 
First they say my debit card needed approval, then they said their servers for instant pay were down. Then the email I got from them said that I won't get the money until Friday. Then they stated that it was a fault of my debit card WHICH WAS FINE IN THE FIRST PLACE! They even told me I would have the money in my account on Monday, December 12, 2016. But they kept changing that date as well and pushed it back even until December 16, 2016. This is the worst customer service that I have ever experienced in my entire life!!!

It's a very simple matter. I've been using UberEATS to place orders for food. It has a program in place where if you refer someone you get 15 off. I had 3 invite codes so I placed an order for a pizza. The total came to 4.99 with my 15 off discount (which I have the receipt saved for it). Afterwards they went into my account and altered it without my knowledge and removed my promos after I placed the order and sent out a receipt for 19.99. I called them and they slightly hinted towards my account being altered by someone in email support but they didn't expand on that matter and acted as if they didn't see any of my invite codes. 
I contacted email support which within itself is a problem because you never speak to the same rep between messages it's always alternating, so make a long story short they kicked me off the referral program without a discernible explanation and refuse to refund me for the previous honored deal that was placed before I was kicked off the program. This isn't the first time I've had problems with them but it's getting old and dealing with multiple support agents saying multiple things is tiresome. Had I done anything wrong I'd accept the ruling but I know I did nothing wrong. I was silenced and refused the chance to reply to random messages from random agents.

I ordered for an Uber pool today which is the 12/08/2016. Not only did Uber give a wrong pick up location to the driver but also charged my card twice for the correct rate and incorrect rate. After waiting 10 min in the cold for the driver, I had to direct him to the right pick up location. When he picked me up, he advised he had to first pick up to people at the Marriott which was ok with me because I had ordered for Uber pool anyway. We pick up the couple and I was dropped first. 
Later when I got the chance to look at my Uber receipt, I noticed they had charged me price that they did not quote for me at the time I was ordering the Uber. On checking my bank account I was charged twice by Uber for the right price they had quoted for me and the wrong price which I think was for the couple I pooled with. They reversed the right fare I was quoted for charging me for the wrong fare plus booking fees and dc Uber taxes which have never been charged before. 
I am so disappointed in Uber and the fact that they do not have a number to call is frustrating. Their service is helpful but I think they are becoming rip offs and unless I get my money back, I will never use Uber again or recommend it to anyone. This is the second time Uber is charging me a wrong fare that was not originally quoted and now I was charged twice and I can't seem to reach out to anyone for help.

I worked with UberEATS for about 2 months. I accepted 100% of requests and made deliveries as quickly and efficiently as possible. One evening, there was a $20/hour promotion. It was held from 5pm to 9pm. I logged on using their app at 4:57 pm and did not log off until 9:00 pm. I looked at the app later that evening and it said I was on for only 3 hours and 21 minutes. The next day, it said 3 hours and 30 minutes. Then, when I let the help department know that this was not correct, and clearly explained why, I was told by two separate people that I was only on for 2 hours and 48 minutes. A third person said I was on for 3 hours and 47 minutes. 
I have written over 20 messages to support only to be told things like, ""I'm glad you have the personality you do and Uber values your partnership. You must have accidentally logged off..."" and things like that. I absolutely did not log off. One of the help service agents said I logged off between 7:45 and 8:15. Why would I do that? And I accepted a delivery at exactly 8:15. How would I accept it if I weren't logged in? It's insane. I can't believe the amount of time they spent telling me I'm incorrect in my calculations. It's pretty simple; the app has a glitch. They refuse to just compensate me what they owe me. I'm DONE with Uber.

I leased a car thru Uber leasing program in Tampa Honda. I was not given a choice of car and wound up with a 2015 Corolla with stains and burn holes on the seats. The dealership never sent a tag for the car despite me contacting them daily regarding my tag about to expire. They wouldn't issue a new temp tag, told me they mailed it out on 3 different dates and NY temporary tag expired. I couldn't drive the car illegally so it sat there for over a month until they repossessed it. I called the leasing company and was told over $1200 to redeem the car in 4 days. I called on 4th day and was told now it was over $1400 to redeem the car that day.
They said I didn't need commercial insurance and that is a bold face lie. When I tried to deactivate my account so I could cancel my insurance on a repo car, Uber refused saying I still owed on the lease. My insurance was cancelled for driving commercially. I wound up with no car, no job, losing my home and my son and I are now homeless.

After landing at Oklahoma City airport 11/28/16 for business, I requested an uber pick up to take me to my hotel. The driver was very nice and the rate was reasonable at $20.31. I then requested an uber pick to take me from the same hotel on 12/4/16 to take me to the Oklahoma City for my return flight. When I received the charge it was $40.83.
I sent an email to uber's customer service department that stated all of the above with the dates of travel and location of hotel, asking why I was charged double. First they replied saying they could not help me without the exact location of travel. I replied saying that 1) the locations were stated in my initial email. 2) my email is attached to my uber account. Do they not have access to all of their drivers trips.
They again replied saying that because of my location an suv was sent therefore the double charge was correct. I did not request an suv. It was just me. I am in the hospitality/service business and I am completed appalled at the way they handled this issue. I am reimbursed for the charges when on business and I still will never use Uber again.

They do not pay enough anymore to work for. Does not even cover costs to operate and maintain a vehicle AND make a minimum wage from. Too many short rides which = NO MONEY. $2.96 each short ride. They have implemented price cuts, and they have reinforced surges (which are your only REAL hope for making enough money to pay bills) to where it is almost impossible to get a surge fare now unless you're downtown on a Saturday night, which might I add all other drivers are there, too, giving you even more competition. 
You'll make 5 times more money delivering pizza, not even kidding. And you won't have to deal with the rude people getting in and out of your car slowly ruining it. Corporate does not give a crap about you or your car, just the money you're earning THEM. So if you're thinking about driving for them, get on, do 30 rides, collect your $100 referral bonus from them, and dip and switch to LYFT.

I felt very safe while he was giving us about a 15 minute ride to a suburb of Atlanta! Same ride would've probably cost nearly $50 with a cab!!! I will take Uber whenever I can!"

My son accidently left his laptop in an Uber car. He realized that just a few minutes after the Uber car already gone. He tried to contact the driver through Uber apps, however the driver was not helpful at all. The Uber management try to help but cannot force the driver to help since the driver is an independent contractor which does not have direct responsibility to the management. Characteristic of relationship between driver and management at Uber, make passenger vulnerable. Passenger cannot ask the management to be responsible of the driver behavior."

Last night (Nov. 18), Uber driver Dietrich in Torrance/Redondo Beach took off with my 17-year-old daughter's birthday money, gift cards, bank card, and expensive purse (~$350 total) when she briefly stepped out of the car as they stopped the ride to pick up a friend. She literally chased after the Toyota Yaris, but he wouldn't stop. She called the driver; he told her he'd come back. She waited two hours until 1 a.m. and he didn't. She contacted Uber support, who contacted the driver, who of course denies anything was in the car."

EXTREMELY disappointed with Uber. 5 days ago my account with Uber was hacked and someone in Australia (I am a US resident and have never even traveled there) charged my card upwards of $100. I had to cancel my credit card and am currently moneyless as I am away at school with no bank nearby. I have contacted Uber FIVE times and NO RESPONSE whatsoever. I cannot cancel my account as Uber does not allow customers to call a support line, forcing me to communicate via messages through my account. Ironically, none of my messages have been answered and someone is still attempting to use my account. The company does not allow you to remove credit card information from your account unless you add in another. I will never use Uber again and I recommend you do not either. If something goes wrong you will have no help whatsoever from this unprofessional company."

Oct 20th ride from Milwaukee Airport to downtown which normally takes 15 minutes and did take that time again. Driver wrote down 25 minutes and charged me $61.00. It was my first and last ride with Uber. Driver lied and scammed me. You cannot get Uber by phone and neither can my credit card company. Their help does not work well and I got no answer.

For two weeks in a row while traveling for work in DFW the drivers have constantly refused to come get me because I'm outside the ""gate"". I take the bus to remote south to avoid the airport gouge price and have the city bus as a back up option. It should not matter where I am on the airport property as long as there is public access I should be able to get a ride to my destination. Especially since you have to pay money just to request a ride! I will not be using Uber again after these two horrible weeks."

When I first began operating as legal public utility transportation company serving my island community here in Hawaii, I was desperate for new business and Uber could not find an actual insured, state or county LICENSED transportation company to serve our airport. After being heavily recruited to put my BMW's in their Black-Select service at the airport with assured decent compensation, I took them up on their offer with one perspective - if they have customers that are ready NOW who will pay their fares, I would have been a fool not to be the only Uber available at a popular airport serving the wealthiest travelers in the US... & be doing it legally in the eyes of state and county governmental as an INSURED AND LICENSED PUC operator.
Our investment: We paid the Seller's hefty regulated license cost of the PUC certificates, bought/financed BMW cars, insured them FIRST/prior to our lawful APPLICATION to transfer those certificates as prescribed by law. Then we waited for two and half months and received our lawful passenger transportation license recognized by state and county government. After 7-10 days of ""processing"" my application, we finally got started. Then the ""Comedy of errors"" began.
My average wait time at the airport was 5-90 minutes, no flights brought Uber passengers before 10:00 AM or after 3:30PM until the next wave of long over the water flights came in at 8:00 PM to about 10:00PM, and then nothing. Some days you couldn't lose, most days you got 1-3 runs to a nice resort and filled in the gaps. It started out like a good date then went south.
Uber history if you didn't know: Uber started out and for several years only used limo services thus their ""illegality"" was moot. They operated as a travel agency referring rides to idle town car drivers filling in dead time, excellent idea. After Uber was called out on UberX unlicensed vehicles and drivers masquerading as low cost taxis, they did the ""political pivot"" and said they were a technology company, not a transportation company subject to the local/state licensing requirements. They played the ""extra income for single mom's & struggling two income families making ends meet"" card. What they neglect to say is that newly directed income to Uber drivers rightfully belongs to the LICENSED operators paying the fees, insurance and being subjected to government scrutiny.
Ohhh... The DRUNKS!! After six semi-successful winter months, one Saturday night, these idiots drunks complained after a reggae concert that I would not go to a wild street party and leave the airport to pick up UberX rides as a Black car which in one night's complaints, drove my score down to 4.6 - they turned off my apps and said via ""chat"" that I needed to take an online customer service class for $37. Since my company began, my rating had earned 12 consecutive five stars, which most carefully worded letters of customer praise and satisfaction. And, I had well over 1,000 trips under my belt, and heard daily ""this is the nicest Uber I have ever been in."" Like I need to take a $37 ** class on customer satisfaction!
I refused to be punished for choosing not to get vomit in my car, puke smells for days and the stains NEVER come out - I refused to take the course or I was out. A Honolulu manager called, begged me to pay the $37 and take the course after I openly voiced my anger over the BS they expected me to put up with, and after weeks of cutting our referring percentage to Uber from 20% to 27.5%, I looked harder for my own business, succeeded and told Uber where to put it. If you now have drawn the conclusion that I may know a little bit more than the next civilian, read the points below to see where the real problems lie.

                        
                    
                        
                            What local governments are not aware of: 
1. Who is driving? Uber refuses to submit driver profiles for vetting. We should be ""OK"" with their own SF background checks. Really? 
2. Does the driver have experience in this field that may require SOME basic fundamentals, like not stopping in traffic to drop a rider? Our island requires a 50 question local knowledge test in English to get a 75% or higher or NO LICENSE TO DRIVE TAXIS. GPS is OK occasionally but not as a guide to deliver people safely. 
3. No breath test by a supervisor, drunk, stoned, stupid? Self supervised, really? 
4. Absolutely NO local supervision or manager phone contact in an emergency.
5. No commercial insurance or hotel insurance endorsements. 
6. No legally obtained or intended transportation certificates applied for or granted. 
7. No safeguards to ensure drivers don't offer riders 20% off their return ride if they pay cash - it happens all day long. 
8. Surge is the biggest unchecked scam - many nights and days the app would say ""2.5x"" which translated to 2.5 more requests than drivers available. Then you sit there waiting for a dispatch and then nothing... silence, no runs but the duped riders didn't know that more drivers were really available than advertised. This is Fraud!! 
9. Dangerous drivers - I submitted a clear photo to Uber mgt of a dizzy driver with three toddlers and three adults in a Chevy Malibu, TWICE, and he still is driving!!
Driving people is a serious business and the younger crowd don't get it yet because they haven't been to enough DUI funerals for friends to register that Uber is absolutely absent when it comes to knowing if their drivers are sober, high, oversexed or too inexperienced and crash focusing on a GPS instead of just knowing their town like a pro or at a minimum, a pizza delivery man. Uber's convenience does not bear more value than common sense regulation of passenger safety. Laws were written to avoid problems and punish offenders, Uber thinks they're above that threshold, how obtuse or arrogant can you be?

I have been driving for Uber for four months now. This past Halloween weekend, which is also a very busy football weekend in the area where I live and drive, I drove expecting and knowing that there would be surge pricing. We have some 1000+ college students coming into town for the FL/GA football game. I picked up three different groups of riders from the surging area (it was surging for two solid hours - that is how busy we were). When I got home after these trips I noticed that the fares were not close to what the surge pricing would make them. I immediately emailed customer service about each one of the trips, because you cannot do them but one at a time. I could not get them to understand that the surge pricing was not showing up like it showed on the map.
I received the same lame computer generated response, which made it clear to me either it was a computer responding, or it was someone that did not speak or understand ENGLISH. I receive responses that plainly showed to me that they are not comprehending that the app was acting up. I received responses from 15 different representatives, and 40+ emails wasting hours of my time and theirs and it has been five days and still no one has comprehended what the problem was or compensated me for my driving. It is a simple fix, as I know that they track everything in real time. I have corresponded with them prior and know that they keep GPS on the drivers at ALL TIMES. And yes probably on the riders also. Spooky huh?
Uber also stated in one email, when I asked to speak with a supervisor or someone that understood english, that they claim that they do not have that capability. WHAT??? Probably because it is computer generated and no actual person is in control. I would NOT recommend driving for UBER. They stiff both drivers AND riders. They also claim that they send requests for pickup to the closest driver at the time, but I know that is NOT true. I have had several trips where the rider/s was in the car with me, requesting a driver and they send someone miles away. I thought the first time this happened that perhaps it was a glitch, but when it happens over and over, and you end up giving the person a ride totally free of charge because they are already in the car with you and the app is not sending me the request or even showing on their app that I am available.
I do not understand why they would send drivers that are so far away when I was literally inches away. They want us drivers to waste our money and gas driving to pick up a rider that is farther away and not sending the closest driver and having the rider waiting for long periods. I thought the idea was so that riders did NOT have to wait too long. Now as soon as I hit send, I will bet that my account will be suspended. Like I said they track EVERYTHING... WWWHHHOOO. Yes it's spooky.

On Oct. 7, 2016 we needed a ride to the airport so we called Uber. We needed a XL truck. Randy came in a Lincoln Navigator. Soon as the meter started he said ""I need gas."" Now mind you the meter already started. We get to the gas station. He decides to stop the meter and cancel the trip. At $9.98, you won't get charged. He said ""But we're 1/2 a mile from our starting point."" So, he ends the trip, gives himself 5 stars. So we start over. He says he'll fix it. Instead of getting on the freeway he drives down Gratiot. I'm like ""what's wrong with the freeway."" He replied ""Uber is saying this is the way to the freeway."" Okay, traffic is light, it might cut off 5 mins. Then when we get by the freeway entrance he makes a wrong turn. I'm from Detroit and know how to get around.
So I say ""Where you going? This isn't the right way."" Oh he says and turns around. Goes down 1/2 a block to the freeway. His response is ""You were right."" When we get to the airport he passes the Jet blue drop off and has to circle around running up the meter. When we finally get to the drop off zone he says ""Call me and I'll pick you up, off the meter for $50 flat rate. Now I just paid $82.12 for the second ride. Please!!! So, I report it to Uber. They offer me a $10 credit. I'm not using your service again. What didn't you understand when I said that...

In many occasions almost daily bases Uber has underpay. Misentered time and mileage. Of course I have done my best to adjust the correct payment or close to compromising amount, but costing me spending long times to get corrections. This has become a common practice by Uber. I wonder if all drivers have such time or knowledge to claim their fair amount. Repetition of this practice is so often that I would like the authorities look into the matter to protect the drivers who don't realize or have no means."

My friend and I called for an UBER to pick us up and take us back to my friend's place which was about 3 miles away. First he was 15 minutes late, I had to get the security guard to get on the phone with him to locate him as he could not find us. We walked to his car once he arrived, I noticed he was taking us on a longer route, as we had taken an Uber to get to the same place before a simpler much shorter route.
As we arrived, he saw that my friend was not feeling well in the back seat, he started screaming at her and grabbed her so violently by her arm and very rudely shouting ""get her out of the car"". The charge was about 32 dollars for the fare. The next day I get an email that says I was charged 150 for a clean up fee. That's just ridiculous. My friend woke up saying her arm hurt, and I looked and saw his finger marks on her arm from the night before. This is not an acceptable way to treat your customers. People Uber to not get into car accidents when they have been drinking, she threw up in the car, yes, but you have no right to inflict harm on your customer, and charge them $150 to clean up vomit? That's just ridiculous. I will never take Uber again because of this terrible experience.

On 22 Sept I took Uber from the Orlando Airport to Kissimmee for a cost of $90.57. On 25 Sept I took Mears Transportation on return to the airport and was charged $62.00. If Uber is supposed to be cost effective but their rate is almost $30 more than a licensed transportation company then what is the purpose of allowing them to operate in metropolitan areas? I was charged a base fare, a distance fare, time fare, 2 tolls and an airport surcharge. I checked the receipt I received from Mears to compare costs but found nothing comparable. Furthermore, I looked for ways to contact Uber but the only avenue I found was Facebook and my issue was ignored."

Uber confirmed cancellation, nonetheless, charged me $5.00 for cancelling because 9 minutes had passed! WHAT A RIP OFF!! And now they are trying to introduce flying cars!! It appears ripping off ON THE GROUND is not satisfying the thievery urges of the CEO! I asked Uber for a refund.

I have a PSA...Uber doesn't care. This is not shade or shame. My Uber account was hacked earlier this week by someone in Australia...yes ""the down under"". I like to travel but have never been to Australia. I tried contacting Uber via email through their website...they don't have a phone number to contact??? I sent 6 emails reporting the activity and asking for someone to contact me. I included screen shots of the receipts of the fraudulent trips that were taken under my account and to deactivate my account. 
Also the email receipts that came in a foreign language. Since yesterday I can't get into my account and still no contact from an Uber representative. My bank has taken care me on their end...but Uber should at least acknowledge the issue I brought to them. I'm using social media to help get the attention of Uber and asking for anyone who can to deactivate their Uber accounts and uninstall their app to please do so. There are other companies you can use. Uber is a 500 billion dollar company currently and no one from the company cares to address the fraudulent activity happening through their company.

First, I would like to explain that I have NEVER nor will I now EVER have an Uber Driving Company. I received numerous fraudulent charges from the company. I tried to contact them via the phone number attached to the charge from my bank as well as via email. The phone number told me to send an email (because the phone messages get distorted or some BS) to support@uber.com...so I sent the email, and almost immediately I received a response that the email had NOT been received to go to the website and search for a response to my question...well without an acct, I cannot contact anyone.

We took Uber from Coral Springs to Fort Lauderdale airport. As we passed the security we realized that we left one item (painting rolled-up) in backseat. We contacted Uber right away through the app and had to wait 20 more minutes for Uber to put us with the driver on phone. He did not speak any English so we got a fellow passenger to talk to him. He said he can come in 10 minutes and meet us where he dropped us. But we were boarding and did not have enough time. At that point he gave us his phone no. and we told him we will call him in 4 days when we get back. 
4 days later, upon our arrival, we called him and asked about the painting and he goes no painting. I had a Spanish person call him but he totally refused that he does not have any painting. We have contacted Uber so many times but no help at all. They should really stand behind their customers. Should get rid of dishonest people and should not hire any body who can not communicate in simple English. After having this horrible experience I will never use Uber again.

Doesn't matter if you agree to price surge. You are forced to agree when you have no other means of transportation and need to get home.

I started driving for Uber when I saw an ad on my phone claiming that I can make up to $35/hour. I drove for a total of about 30 trips. I came nowhere near making $35/hour. The fact is, after my expenses, I made as little as.15 cents per mile, equaling my guess of less than $4/hour. After around 60 days, I received a notice that I had to pay for a car inspection. This is when I decided to stop driving for Uber. So I have two complaints: The first is that Uber is falsely advertising the pay rate for their drivers. How can they keep getting away with this? Second, when I informed them that I would no longer drive for them, they blocked me as a rider. Childish and petty are the words I would use to describe Uber's business practices."

There is no way you can do that through your account profile. I waited on them to send me a link so I can do it. I finally did it. I received an approval and I was ready to go.

I go through my email to find out that they did a second background check for some reason and listed me in San Francisco even though I live and have all my paperwork from IL. 
So again weeks of explaining, talking to an actual person from Checkr - the company that does the background check, only to find out that this is solely UBER's mistake because they listed me in the wrong city. And the person from Checkr said they just need to review this and fix it. After numerous of emails again and people that have absolutely no idea of what they are doing, after promises that they will look into this and I will get a response in 48hrs... a week later they finally sort everything out and my account was activated yesterday. Only to get an email and a message that because of long inactivity they will deactivate my account if I don't take a trip within 3 days of now. Really???

Uber is about the worse company for customer service. You can only deal with emails back and forth until you give up. This practice should be illegal. They should be required to have an active customer service line where people can call to have their problems resolved. For one their surcharge pricing is nothing short of price gouging. My daughter has had to pay $31 for an $8 fare. Also on a different trip when my other daughter left her bag in a car, the driver never got back to us and Uber just kept emailing contact the driver. It was ridiculous.
Wish they had Lyfts by us. Uber is a great concept but they are really blowing it. My last issue was when they tacked $80 on for cleaning to one of my daughters Uber charges. After the driver told her and her friends there would be no additional charge, we didn't even bother trying to call and complain because we know you cannot complain or even reach a customer service agent. This will become a very dangerous practice. Someone will need to step in and insist they have customer service agents available to speak to.

I strongly discourage everyone from using Uber. It's only worked 1 out of the mere 3 times that I tried using it, which is plenty enough for me to steer clear for life. The other 2 occasions were a complete nightmare; the second time I tried it, I was informed that my ride would arrive to my work place in 6 minutes, but then it changed to 12 minutes then finally 32 minutes. Eventually I was waiting for an hour and a half and finally gave up. I'm sure that if I had waited longer it never would have arrived. Yet, I must mention that while watching the map on my iPhone to see when the driver was close, I specifically saw another Uber driver no more than a mile or 2 away and they just kept going. 
The third time I tried using Uber I entered where I needed to be picked and my destination. I noticed on the map however that the driver was going straight to my (end) destination. I then texted him to clarify where I was, but he called me irritated because he was, as I suspected, at the place where I needed to be and not where I was waiting to be picked up. He claimed that I entered my address wrong and that he was in an entirely different city! I know everyone makes mistakes and apps can be glitchy, but waiting for an hour and a half one day with a no show, plus the app sending my driver to the wrong place (but apparently it was my fault) another day is the worst customer service I've ever had. This thing needs to be shut down.

I have to stop the trip, he threatened me he will let Uber give me $0 pay for trip and he will get free ride, so now, within a few hours, I got $0 pay for that trip and my rating dropped 3 points. I email Uber about the bad experience I got no reply so far. I suspect Uber listen to the feedback from driver side. Uber only care about rider and how much money they make. They provide no protection for woman driver."

Uber charges me twice every time I request it, it charges me immediately after the end of the trip and it deducts money from my account again a few days later. I've lost so much money because of this and I'm not happy at all."

This is not the way to charge anything? I did not get any notifications for extra surge charges on my applications as well as I want my money back otherwise I will have to go to the consumer forum to fix this issues as you people are charging unnecessary charges to the customers without any prior information, though I have personally talk to driver and he was standing at LIG square which is only 1.5 kilometer away from pickup locations.
Sorry to mentioned but if I will not get my money back then for sure I will going to escalate this issue with consumer forum and also request to high court regarding stop immediately service provider as they are taking charges from innocent people with unknown reason. IF YOUR COMPANY DOES HAVE HIGH TRAFFIC AND TOUGH FOR YOU TO DELIVER THE SERVICE THEN FIRST I SHOULD AWARE ABOUT IT. I will never going to follow such sarcastic company if I will not get my money back as before also you people charged the amount and I did not highlight the issue.

Former Uber partner drivers review. Worst experience driven with Uber. I never ever suggest to anybody to drive with Uber. They're more depends on Rating System. If your rating goes down, you will be fired and you will be behind the Bills. They don't care. Uber made the system in favour of the customers not the drivers who providing the safe ride in frustrating situation. Moreover Uber making the money not the drivers. If you calculate the earnings you made, you will be on minimum wage. So my advice to every newcomer: don't finance the car to join Uber. Better than do something else. Don't go to Uber. My zero star to Uber."

I've only been driving with UBER for a couple of weeks in my spare time. So far my experiences with the riders has been great, but UBER now claims that my customer rating are low 4.6% and that I have only picked up 94% of the fares offered, which is NOT True. I've accepted every single fare that popped up on my phone. And you, as a driver, have no way to look at your actual customer ratings yourself. So now, it seems that I've been suspended until I pay to take a 3 hour online course!
Here in my city I wind up making about $9 an hour, and pay for my own gas and car washes daily. In the first 2 days I put over 300 miles on my car, and they don't pay for mileage driving to pick up a fare, only once that person is in your car. GPS is a nightmare, guiding you to wonky places... A church across the street from the School pick up location, an alley behind a home once and a truck stop parking lot behind a Quick Trip on another occasion ""the rider was out front""... Plus it's difficult to find a break in the day to visit a ladies room or to eat. It's sooooo not worth it. Really not worth it.

My friends and I (4 females) were leaving Oracle Arena in Oakland California after a concert to go back to our hotel. We waited 1 hour and watched him pass us and several times before he actually stopped. We got on the freeway and rode for about 5 mins and he said we cancelled the ride. We hadn't cancelled at all. He pulled off the freeway under a dark bridge surrounded by abandoned buildings and said ""get out"" because he wasn't insured. It was about 1 AM. We begged and pleaded to take us to a place populated with lights and offered to pay cash.
A police car passed. I rolled the window down to wave for help. He rolled the windows up and put on the child locks so we couldn't get out. Our phones were going dead. He said ""what are you gonna do?"" We managed to call Uber and request another ride. He started driving around and the other Uber driver had to find us as we yelled out landmarks and street signs. Only after he saw the other driver did he unlock the doors. This was the scariest thing I have ever experienced. This was my second ride with Uber. The first was earlier the same day going to the concert.

After giving 1000 rides for Uber I was deactivated (fired) for low ratings (which is 4.6). I was told to take a on-line course which I had to pay for to be re-instated. Forget that. Uber thinks that all their riders are sober, sane, and kind people. Well they're NOT! I put up with so much nonsense for a $4 ride I should write a book. Uber never talks to a driver. If a driver has a problem it's ** outta luck time. Uber hides behind a computer and never communicates directly with any driver. They take whatever a riders says at face value, no questions asked. I think there should be a class action lawsuit for firing without cause. How could a company hire and fire hundreds of employees a week? Pay averages out to $12 to $15 dollars an hour. You pay gas and maintenance on your vehicle and car washes are not cheap. Riders, what do you want? Because a safe ride from point A to point B is all you're paying for."

When I arrived at Spokane, WA. I was highly recommended to utilize uber. When I scheduled my appointment via their app, the price was quoted anywhere from $11-$15. When you use their app you don't know what you are being charged until 5 mins after you leave the car when I got the shock of my life $53.46 to travel 15 mins. Way, way more than a cab. I was told I was charged $41 surcharge and that I was supposed to have been informed of this. So upset with uber, that I have vowed to never use them ever again and will tell all my friends, co-workers etc. of my upsetting experience! To add, I had to tell the driver to cut off the meter and get my own bags out of the trunk! Absolutely unacceptable!"

I used Uber for the first time on Saturday morning - 24.09.16. After my friend booked me a taxi via her phone. I had never heard of the company before, as I don't use many taxis. I wasn't aware at the time of booking - payment is taken. The taxi driver asked how much I had been quoted online as I was leaving Didsbury, Manchester to Prestwich. The taxi meter was set at £3.75 and he stated the journey was approx 20 miles. I felt confused at the time as the driver appeared to be questioning how I was going to pay. I informed him I didn't have money and therefore he would have to stop at an atm. He took me the longest way home and I was charged nearly £54 for the journey!
The driver never once informed me that the payment was already confirmed and accepted online at the time of booking. It wasn't until I had spoken with my friend within a few hours - she had already paid for the journey online - £28. Therefore the journey cost a huge £82!! I feel completely violated and apoplectic towards the company for being overcharged. The driver has taken advantage of my vulnerability on traveling alone in the early hours... I am still waiting to hear from the company about the overpayment!

Uber's customer accounts has been hacked and they are not reporting it to their customers. This will show up when you start getting unexpected charges on the credit card you listed on your account. You may get a receipt in your email for a trip or even Uber Eats in another state where you haven't traveled. On Uber Eats they can actually order food and have it delivered, and the total bill will be charged to your credit card. We had 2 for over $80. Since Uber has no efficient way to contact their Customer Support you may have to get creative to get their attention by sending messages through their Help system. If you are an Uber user you should consider changing your password immediately and possibly closing your account altogether. Of course you can't just do this simply and easily. Again you have to find a way to send them a message."

I left my cell phone in an Uber and I was unable to contact the driver because of it. Uber customer was terrible and kept telling to call the driver. Eventually, I changed the phone number associated with my Uber account so I could log in and call the driver but there was no phone number or option to call him... The APP told me to input the number. I explained this to customer service and they responded, ""Sorry you lost something, the best thing to do is to call your driver."" REALLY? Same answer 3 times.
Next, my receipts were not being emailed to me. I set up a business account so they would. I received 1 and then none. I'm missing 5 receipts that I need to turn into my boss. Again, customer service told me to go to the APP and then emailed. I followed instruction and behold... NO OPTION to do that. They only email and only email in the middle of night.

I am shaking as I write this post. I had to pull over to gather my thoughts. As I was driving west on century just outside the airport an Uber driver (black Prius, I believe-or something similar) turned right on to century directly in front of me and another car. We both slammed on our breaks and swerved to the left to avoid an accident. As he approached my right side, he rolled down his window and gave me the middle finger while yelling at the top of his lungs saying ""** YOU, go back to your country."" I'm sorry, I was born and raised in LA. I have white skin with blue eyes. My son has blonde curly hair. Do we stand out as foreigners? Even if we did, would that be a bad thing?
The driver wouldn't stop with his aggression. He kept swerving over into my lane and the people behind us were honking. He followed me almost to my destination while following extremely close until I turned onto Lincoln while heading north on sepulveda. He was close enough to get a picture of him in his Uber car, sorry for the dirty window lol. What an idiot. While at light he started taking off his shirt saying ""come on"". I'm a woman, what was he going to do? He was extremely aggressive and was an Uber driver. I'm sure he picks up a wide variety of people.
He is a danger to our community and if you see this man, just know he is incredibly racist and should not be trusted with your safety. I have not had positive experiences with Uber and trying to contact them to report issues is almost impossible. It's too bad people like this are employed by Uber. It's not always about the money, sometimes you have to be careful who you employ. Our safety should come first.

I heard some great things about Uber and when a friend recommended using it, I seen no reason not to give it a try. The trip by cab would have been approximately 50.00 but I was quoted between 26-30 by Uber, so I asked for one. It was a 14.5 mile trip, one way. While waiting, a message came up asking if I wanted to use surge x4. I had no idea what this meant. There was no one to ask and it flashed up so quickly that I just said yes. 
The Uber then showed up right away and I had no time to deal with this situation. I did ask the driver how much my ride would be and was again quoted 26 to 30.00. Imagine my disgust when the ride was done and I was charged 111.77!!! I couldn't believe it. I had no choice but to pay. I contacted Uber 3 times and they refused to take off the 80.00 SURGE charge. They offered me a 25% discount next ride (Like I will EVER use Uber again!). I have filed a complaint with the BBB and will now go to my bank to refute the charge of 80.00 slapped on. What a ripoff. You cannot call Uber, you have to email them. There is no phone number!

On 9/4/2016 I dropped off a rental truck in Arizona at an open well lit location. I requested an Uber ride and within 3 minutes he drove past me and then cancelled the ride. I then requested another car which just drove past me. I finally had to walk to a convenience store after my phone died and call a real taxi who promptly showed up and took me home. I complained to Uber about each driver and only after 3 emails (for each driver) did my complaint actually get read. So I deleted the app and will not use these losers again.

I would never recommend it to anyone. I had a very bad experience with Uber leasing and I will not suggest anyone to go for it. I thought it's a very good idea to lease it from them. I applied, I got approved, and once again I gave a thought for couple of days to take it or not. Meanwhile I was getting email and text messages from Uber, ""You have a week left. After that you don't get it you need to reapply."" After my days expired I went and asked, and they said, ""We can give it for you,"" and they were so nice while giving the car. They took 250 nonrefundable deposit from me and after 2 days gave me the car.
After driving for 1 day the next day it was raining and I was heading home 2 in the morning, and a lady made a sudden U-turn, and crashed into my car and other car. She was at fault. I then contacted Uber through email. They didn't reply at first. Then I contacted the dealer from where I took the car. She says that ""Now it's your car. You leased it and you are responsible for the payments."" 
I asked her before getting the car. She said, ""If something happens we will take care of it."" I told her the same thing so she said, ""You are responsible for the weekly payments,"" and later I received email from my Uber saying I am responsible for the payments. And they closed my Uber driver account till my car get fixed, and now Uber is only my source of income. I didn't had any other job to do and the lady who hit me had a worst insurance company, and was playing me so I had to go through my insurance company by paying 1000 dollars deductible where I was not having money. 
Now anyway I have to fix the car. I cannot leave it as it is because it's the lease car. They need it as they gave it to me. I borrowed money from friends and family. When the car got fixed it took almost 7 weeks because of the insurance company and Uber. I lost my Uber weekly income plus 1000 dollar deductibles, plus 1600 Uber lease for 7 weeks, and wage loss for 3000, altogether loss for almost 5600 dollars in 7 weeks only because of Uber. And if anyone want to deal with Uber lease then read it then go for it if you are ready for all this. Uber doesn't care. They just need to make money. Now I am repaying to pay the debts every week from my pay cheque.

Monday evening 08-22-16; Myself, My Husband, Sister and Brother in-law contacted Uber via the mobile App. Upon doing so we were quoted a $80 ride, with possible surge increase. However the app did not in detail describe or calculate the total. So I agreed with ignorance assuming that it could not be more than a few extra bucks. Later informed by Uber that their Uber drivers were in ""High Demand"", however that isn't something I would know so I cannot say why the surge was even there? I don't travel to the city often or for that matter do so during large events. Upon traveling from N. Clark to the western suburb of Lombard, IL. Not only did our Uber driver Victor take a longer route than what we suggested, he then charged us a whopping $300.27 for the ride. That's a 3.9% increase against the normal rate. I cannot say how that is even feasible, how that is even logical or where they could calculate such an amount. 
I have more than enough Tweets, Facebook messages, Uber communications, Instagram posts noting that they scammed me out of this money. From an ex-Uber driver responding to my Instagram photo she claimed this is a normal practice and they are well aware of this scam and allow it to continue. I have a family of 6. Two in early education and two in college. We are not a family of extreme wealth and NO one should ever be scammed out of such money for any reason. I know I am not the only one, but that others know this is a problem and Uber allows it to continue.

In the process she tries to yank my glove compartment open and kept messing with it to the point that she broke it, after breaking my glove compartment she vomited all over the inside and outside of my vehicle.
I made the necessary procedures and contacted Uber for a reimbursement for the damages done to my vehicle. Uber did not contact me until after several days of the incident, as requested by them I sent them pictures of the damages. Uber then stated that I was filing a false claim. I lost days of work because of the stench in my car left by the rider's vomit. I had to get my car shampooed and detailed on my own and pay out of my own pocket. Uber kept giving me the runaround about getting my cleaning fee reimbursed and never addressed my broken glove compartment and then stated it was wear and tear of my vehicle, mind you my vehicle is brand new so it definitely not wear and tear.
After several attempts to get my vehicle fixed and a reimbursement they sent me a final email stating that it was my choice to transport people in my personal vehicle and to file a claim with my insurance. They also stated that my request were being abusive to their support platform and warned me that if I continued to request a reimbursement for the damages they would permanently deactivate my account. Now I have to come out of pocket again and fix the damages on my own. I feel as this is very unprofessional of them and unfair to get treated in this manner and not get treated fairly and the damages taken care of by Uber.

The surge pricing is ridiculous. My coworker and I went to a concert last night. The venue has a designated Uber dropoff and pick up spot so we went there after the concert to call for a ride. Come to find out that our driver was about a 15 minute walk up a muddy hill nowhere near the pickup site. We were forgiving, as we were just happy to have a ride until we got a receipt for $170 due to the surge pricing! We were of course shocked since the ride to the venue cost $36. Needless to say we will not be using uber ever again. I work too hard to be robbed while trying to enjoy one night of fun."

Last Saturday August 8 my husband and I get out the NRG stadium and walk to chachos to ask for an Uber and I said to my husband ""if we don't find a taxi we can wait inside the restaurant"" but when I ask for one was fine. I mean this was my fourth trip with uber and I was happy because 2 times I went to the airport for a charge of 53 us and the third trip was to NRG stadium for 41 US. So I thought it will be similar because publicity always said that they charge per mile. I am new with this application and now I have a charge of 560 Usd for a 36 minutes trip. This is crazy. I am calling customer service so they can explain me how this works but they haven't answer me, so I call my bank so they can open an investigation to check if this can be legal. This can't be right, so be careful with uber, don't trust them and don't get in the car unless you are sure how much they will charge you (Sorry about my English)."

My teenage granddaughter has a profile under my account and Uber added ""select"" as a default option to her profile only. This is not an option on my profile, I never heard of it or was notified that it was added to my granddaughter's profile. They sent a small, old Honda and charged my account 3 times the rate and called it a ""select"" vehicle. I had no clue what this was. I looked it up on the web and it's suppose to be a new luxury vehicle. No authorization from me, not selected by my teenage granddaughter and she was sent a small older UberX vehicle and I was charged 3 times the amount. One trip was $95 to go 20 miles. This trip usually costs $27.

This has been going on for almost 2 weeks. Uber is really pulling a fast one here by adding this ""select"" as a default selection and sending the same old UberX vehicle. I can get NO resolution from them. I've had 3 trips (that I've been able to find so far) that have cost me over $200. They also stopped all activity listings on my account so I can't see the activity. I only found it from the Uber receipt that was emailed to me and the debit from my account. Something needs to be done about this outrageous act by Uber.

My husband called me on 8/6/16 at 1:30 in the morning as he couldn't get his uber account to work and needed a ride home. He was outside of the NRG stadium leaving the guns n' roses concert in Houston Texas. I was tired, sick, groggy and had stayed home. I saw that it said x 8.2 surge charge. I honestly thought this was saying a percentage more as for example 8.2 percent of the trip, say a few extra bucks. Worst case scenario my husband's ride will probably cost around 50 dollars.
I was so upset, shocked and blown away of how uber could charge me 341.73 for a trip that's base fare would have run around 40.00 in the morning. How it was presented was misleading, robbery, and I couldn't get it out of my head how this was legal. All I could think about is how my husband would have inadvertently pushed request uber x without thinking, he might have been drinking. Instead it was me that cried this morning when I saw that I was misled, and still not clear on what it was saying at 1:30 in the am, I couldn't believe it was the cost of a plane ticket??? Our hard earned money gone with a seemingly sneaky and fraudulent move I would expect from a Taxi cab driver, but no we were swindled by previously Money saving uber. Now uber steals from hardworking people, I hope to spread the word on such an unethical move on uber. Shame on you uber.

Tried to use them to get to the airport in S. Francisco. First driver showed up and told us he didn't have a permit to get to the airport, so we had to get another, then the price went up from $29 to over $40 in less than 2 mins. I was charged for 'cancelling'. Odd since I am a first time user and it wasn't my fault! Thought I would give them another chance at National Airport DC. Driver could barely speak English, could not tell me how much the ride would be because he said ""Uber set the price. I don't know how much."" WILL NEVER EVER BOTHER WITH UBER.

Been using Uber daily for the past 2 months. At first no prob. Then the nightmare began. Out of nowhere I am being suddenly charged a booking fee of $1.65 for every ride I request. Uber explains the fee as a necessity to reduce operating costs. Why is that my problem? When you are in business you have operating costs. If you don't want these costs don't be in business. Sucking it your customers is as low a tactic as you can employ.
Additionally, Uber now has surge times that increases the ride price. Uber claims that the demand for rides during those surge times are greater than the amount of drivers they have available. Not only is this too not my problem, the explanation doesn't even make sense. Personally I see it as yet another devious way for Uber to suck it to its customers. Uber also claims that their drivers get paid very little and make more money with surge prices. If Uber compensated their drivers properly instead of keeping most of the money for themselves, there wouldn't be this problem. This is nothing more but greed on Uber's end.
Three days ago I ordered a ride, the driver cancelled, yet I got charged $5.00. I requested a new ride. Somehow I got the same driver again. Again she cancelled, again I got charged $5.00. That same day Uber charged me yet another $5.00 later in the day under the same driver's name for a ride I never requested. It's taken me 3 whole days for Uber to refund me $10.00. The last $5.00 they charged was supposedly refunded in ride credits. Today I requested an Uber ride. I paid full price. There were no ride credits in my account. Uber may have a great idea but the company is greedy and doesn't care about its customers or drivers. It just cares about its own bottom line. That company sucks!

I have had nothing, but trouble dealing with UBER customer service. The only way to contact them is by email since there is NO phone number. Also, you get a reply from a different person each time you reply to an email. The UBER app became usable after a recent Android update, and this caused me to miss a meeting. UBER told me to just reload the app, use a desktop UBER app, download their app from their site instead of Google Play and finally said they fixed it but gave me no way to test it. I have now unloaded my UBER app and loaded LYFT, and they even paid me $50 for my first five rides, where UBER gave me nothing grief!"

There is no customer in their service. It's like speaking to a robot. I normally don't work with any company that doesn't have a customer service phone number and display it on their website, but I tried Uber because of the recommendations.

I was an Uber driver for five months. I became slighted over their referral program. Basically, you share your link with people you want to refer. After their 20th ride the driver receives the referral pay. The first person I referred Uber claimed that the person did not use my referral code. The person told them that she signed up through my link. This was how she found out about Uber. That was the first incident in which I just chucked up the loose. Next, I referred my Godchild. I received a notice that she had completed her 20 rides and I would be getting a payment. This was in February. 
I checked my account and even called my bank to verify the funds. The funds were not in my account. It is now July. I have been sending correspondence back and forth and this situation has yet to be resolved. I have three emails claiming they will put a trace on the money and someone will contact me in 7 days. The 7 days pass and when I send an email I receive a reply saying the issue has been resolved. Do not trust these people. They have proved to be liars.

Most of customers are complaining about drivers being unprofessional because they passed nearby customer when the driver just received the request. The real thing is that Drivers are not responsible for SOFTWARE ISSUES!!! Uber is responsible for that. Uber need to adjust the software for server to pick up riders 3-4 minutes before arriving near customer, but because the programmers are following the UBER RULE to be aggressive taking very fast the customers, they cant solve real problems to pick up customers in a right order so no one cant mistake anything!! Like in a dual carriageway, server dont think that you need to turn around. 
You should stop calling drivers unprofessional, they just doing they job, they dont programming the app like you wanted. Start think before blame drivers from UBER. Uber drivers some are so professional that they even can go to Formula 1 tournament because they are really amazing on they driving skills. Next time try to think outside the box and see the real problem. For example you're sitting in a big roundabout, how you explaining the driver cant reach you if he just received request in the middle of roundabout with red lights and 5 lanes? He cant, he will cancel the trip and you will blame him being fault. He is not fault of systems errors, and that's it.

When I signed up for Uber I remember specifically asking the rep about damage and accidents. His reply was and I quote. ""Don't worry bro. If your app is on and you have an Uber rider in the vehicle, we got you covered. We have an insurance company that handles all that."" I forget the guy's name. He was just one of dozens of people working at the busy little Uber sign up and inspection office. Well, guess what, my car WAS damaged while I had Uber riders in my car. They are Uber riders are they not? I am ""contracted"" by Uber to transport their customers? I know they refuse to call me and hundreds of thousands of other drivers ""employees"" but they can't deny that the riders are ""theirs"".
So I live in Las Vegas, NV. And every once in a while we unfortunately get a few inches of rain, in a very short period of time which causes the city to flood. So I happen to be driving during one of these times and had ""Uber riders"" going to one of the worst pick up/ drop off areas on the strip. Under the Linq hotel and Casino in their tour bus pick up and drop off area (as it is the same with many of the other hotels.) there is a raging river of sorts coming in the direction of where I need to go to drop the riders off. I ask the hotel security guard directing traffic. ""Hey where can I drop off my ""Uber riders""? He just smiles and points up past the raging river of water, and says, ""You know where the drop-off and pick-up area is."" Well it's not that deep and I see other cars driving up, so I follow.
Well about half way up, another security guard is motioning to me, so I roll down my window. ""Hey a piece of your bumper is hanging off your car man.""...Confused I shout back. ""WHAT???"" He yells again. ""A piece of your bumper is hanging off your car."" Still confused I proceed to the drop-off area a dozen or so more feet away from me. The riders get out and I pull over out of the water. Sure as **, there is a large piece of my bumper or ground effects. (I have a custom ground effects package on my car.) The bottom portion that covers my exhaust tips is torn off and hanging by a small sliver of plastic. I pick it up and, the piece easily comes off and I throw it in my trunk. It's late so I go home and try to figure out what to do to get this damage reported and taken care of.
I ask the security person about a report. He says the police won't come because no one was hurt and it's on hotel property. And If I want a statement from him, I have to go through the Hotel security office...Ok...helpful. I go home and type away on my Uber app in the field that says, ""I had an accident."" I go through their questions and take the pictures and hit submit. Easy enough. My car is still drivable and safe. The damage is just cosmetic. So I go to turn the app on in the evening to drive for Uber again. Can't log in. Says ""Your account has not been activated."" WHAT??? I've got almost 200 rides. What do you mean it's not been activated.
Well, come to find out. Uber deactivated my app. They never told me why, just an apology the next day and a 55 dollar credit to my account for the potential loss of money I encountered. (Later I find out that they suspended my account on the fact that I did not send them a particular document related to the accident.) Oh and they called the riders by the way. Because the riders still had my phone number since they were my last ride. I don't know the manner of questions they asked but the riders did verify that they were in the car and the damage had occurred and was legit. (I'm assuming because the insurer for Uber a James River Insurance Co.) acknowledged my claim as legit and was working up an estimate of the amount of damage to my car. I've included some of the correspondence.
They estimated the damage to be around 617 dollars. Lol what a joke. That's not even close. It would be in the thousand to two thousand dollar range because the piece just can't be glued back on. It would have to be replaced and it's part of the entire back piece which in itself cost around 500 dollars and that's just for the piece, not the freight, and then the labor of getting it put on. But I knew I wasn't going to win that argument, so I was just going to take their estimate. So following day, some schmo by the name of Trevor ** calls me and leaves a message for me to call him back with a claim number to reference the phone call. I do, he informs me that even though my claim is valid and the damage is legit, they are not going to give me a dime for any repairs because there is a 1000.00 dollar deductible on this ""particular"" plan.
Yes, you heard me boys and girls. A 1000.00 that's ONE THOUSAND dollar deductible that YOU THE DRIVER is responsible for if damage occurs to YOUR vehicle while an UBER passenger is in your car and it is damaged or in an accident. So, Trevor informs me that ""Since the estimate of damage is under the 1000.00 dollar deductible, there is nothing we can do for you at this time."" Uber is worth BILLIONS with a capital B and they won't pay for the 617 dollars worth of estimated damage to my car??? Just know this drivers, (contractors of UBER) they are full of crap, they don't care about YOU the driver, they don't car about anything other than the ridiculous amount of money they make preying on unsuspecting, uninformed, drivers like you and me.
I wrote them afterward and told them about what the insurance company said, and that they've made more on me or would make more than they estimated. 617 in damage if I got it repaired and stayed a driver for Uber. But guess what, they don't give a crap about you. I included the letter in which they say as much. And it seems that half of the time you deal with customer service for UBER, you get a foreigner because it's outsourced to India and the other half, I get an American whom replies to me. One letter it's JON, the next, it's JABARRI. So, now I'm screwed, I've gotten damage that was according to them, a legit, meaning I met all the qualifications to be a legit claim and they still weaseled their way out of it by claiming a 1000 dollar deductible.
Ever notice on your way bills, on the very bottom it says get a ""certificate of Insurance."" Press that button and it's a certificate of liability insurance. Try to enlarge it. Because it is TINY and you can't enlarge it on your phone. Do it on your computer at home and read it. That's just for the liability. Now call them and ask what your financial responsibilities are if you were to get into an accident or receive damage to your car while transporting a rider. Tell them that you are recording the conversation for your records also. See what they say to you. Uber is a money hungry shady company doing backroom deals and paying out as little as they can to operate as a transportation company, because that's really what they are. They need to be regulated. Call or write you local congressman or senator. I plan too.
Notice too, if the picture downloaded that in the estimate paper they sent me, where it says deductible, it states UNKNOWN. They also had me submit a picture of my Declarations page of my own insurance policy. Why? IF they were the insurance provider on a legit claim, why do they need my dec sheet? Sorry, the pictures won't be downloaded because I have to turn the computer off and then back on. But the documents were of the letter the insurance co. gave me for the est. the pictures of the damage to my car. Well they just ignited a one man crusade. If I could give them no stars I would. I'm never driving for them again and I will be asking Lyft these insurance questions as well.
Luckily I only do this a couple of hours a week because I have a full-time job so it won't hurt me too badly. They rely on that fact to stay in business. The fact that some people quit their full-time jobs and do Uber full-time, so it gives them a ""no choice but to keep driving situation."" Uber is not an honest company. I learned that the hard way. I will now be telling my story to the local politicians that are fighting Uber here in Nevada politically. If this is fuel for their cause, so be it. I'm sorry for the people that rely on this horrible company for their living. They will ** you one way or another.

Absolutely unethical and unfair to drivers. I drove with Uber for almost two years and am ready to delete my App and switch to Lyft. I have clear evidence (screenshots) of multiple occasions where I picked up riders in 1.8 or over surge zone but was paid regular fare. Their regular fare is so low that almost 50% of my trips are under $5 each after Uber fee deduction... Such a joke. No one would let you sit in your car for $3 or something, let alone driving for 1-2 miles to pick the person, drive them another 2-3 miles, spend about 10 minutes of your time and get paid $5 or less... Not to mention that kind of people you end up dealing with, from drug possessing people to those carrying their stupid McDonald burgers into your car, which you then have to drive your car for miles with windows open to get rid of the smell. 
Driving for Uber is like selling your car in bits and prices. You are not making money, instead each time you pick up a rider, you are giving away a piece of your car by depreciating its value. I have done the math, for each $1 you make on Uber, you drive at least 2 miles, then you deduct your car depreciation, your gas, your taxes, and you are left with pretty much nothing. Another capitalist jumping into the market to rob people...

I took an Uber from Downtown Manhattan to Port Authority (42nd & 8th Ave.) and it costs $50!!! Are you kidding me right now!!! First of all the driver obviously didn't know what avenue to take even after I told him. 1 hour to get to midtown... pure BS. And why was it sooo expensive. Because the base fare is $7.00 and then $13.16 for 3.51 miles and then $31.51 for the 49 minutes that I wasted in the damn car. Grand total $51.67. Never again... And I would advise everyone to stay away from Uber if you don't want to get ripped off!!!"

Up until 2 days ago, I had been an Uber partner for over a year and must say their practices are very questionable. 1st point, DRIVERS. How can a company claim they do ""background"" checks, and on countless occasions have the drivers be a bunch of menacing idiots, providing questionable rides in even more questionably safe cars, all the while being more focused on his/her phone conversation than the road. SERIOUSLY?! Now if these checks were, in fact, being done, then why the battle for not allowing drivers to be fingerprinted? It's an honest question, and quite frankly, a legit one. You claim your drivers are safe, but are unwilling to back that up with something so simple as fingerprinting?! LET THE BUYER BEWARE! 
2nd point, GRATUITY. You tell the public that gratuity is included, and is not necessary. Okay, fine, but if a rider wishes to give a little extra to a driver for going that extra mile (no pun intended), you insist to the driver to NOT ACCEPT. First off people, the BIG CLUE here would be in THEIR WORDS, ""TIPPING IS INCLUDED."" How can you 'include' something that the rider may or may not even want to do, let alone a price that would be set by someone other than themselves.
Secondly, I'm quite sure there is some sort of legality here, because how can you justify doing this without allowing the rider the option of opting out of said ""included tip."" Kind of how you can do this at restaurants... which by the way are usually parties of 8 or more. And thirdly, why, on the itemized receipts, was there no listing of what said gratuity was? It listed everything else from, how long the trip was, to what the surge pricing was (if applicable) but not that. It's because, yet again, Uber not only lied to its riders but simultaneously screwed its rideshare partners. It's because it NEVER WAS INCLUDED. In fact, just recently, Uber settled a $100 million lawsuit on this very subject, and STILL refuses to add a spot on the app for a gratuity option for riders. 
3rd point, INCENTIVES. This will be short, because there aren't any. No real motivation for any driver, anywhere, to give their VERY BEST. For me, giving my best was easy, because I wanted to regardless of the circumstances. However, with others, that's the only reason to do so. And it's because of that, that I would hear story, after story, about how my riders ""last"" experience was so horrible which makes me look bad too.
And finally my 4th point, EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. Uber Partners get 1099'd, use their own car, pay their own fuel, clean their own cars, pay for their own repairs which clearly indicates INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, but when you start NOT accepting rides you get bombarded with cute emails warning you of deactivation, clearly indicating EMPLOYEE. How can you dictate what I can and cannot take, and still call us INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS?! The answer is you can't. Which is why I have taken my natural gifts, as a decent human being, and have been GIVING MY ALL to Lyft. 
Lyft is a WAY better company to work for. They offer incentives to drivers and riders alike. They do a more thorough background check on drivers (the evidence of this one is simply not every Uber Partner can become a Lyft Partner, even though both do independent background checks. Interesting huh. Not everyone knows that), and even rider and driver support is actually personable. Not to mention, when was the last time you heard ANY negative situation on the news about a Lyft driver? I have yet to hear one. 
All in all, Lyft maybe the smaller of the 2, but they are growing, and growing the SMART way considering QUALITY over QUANTITY. Sure Lyft, at times, maybe SLIGHTLY more but consider the QUALITY you will be getting. To all the readers of this post, PLEASE consider the switch to Lyft, if you haven't already. Don't let MINIMAL PRICE DIFFERENCE be the deciding factor when choosing a mode of transportation that you expect to get you and your loved ones around. Thank you for reading and be safe out there. --Dedicated Lyft Partner

I have been an Uber driver for a few months now. Uber drivers beware. If you have a rider who is going to get sick in your car, get them out of your vehicle as quickly as possible. Uber does not protect you against damages to your vehicle and getting them to get reimbursement for damage to your vehicle is like pulling teeth. One of my riders got sick in my vehicle. First I tried to download the pictures to their app under ""My rider damaged my vehicle..."" The app doesn't allow me to download. I had to go down to the Uber Center location because Uber doesn't have any over the phone representatives to support you when damage occurs. 
Once the representative at one of their sites and after I submitted documented receipts of the damages to repair my vehicle, I was reimbursed at 60% of what I had to pay to get repaired??? Cannot tell you how disappointing it was to send so many back and forth messages to UBER and the pictures and receipt proof only to be stiffed by UBER. Please know that UBER can care less about your vehicle or you. They only want to get their fare money. Anything else they have to do for you is a hassle to them. My suggestion is next time a rider of yours feels sick, pull over and kick them out of your car and let them know UBER doesn't support their drivers.

In my opinion, Uber does not live up to the ethical standards they claim to have and does not respect their customers. I will avoid Uber to the best of my ability going forward and have moved to using Lyft which is much better. Here’s my experience: I left very nice expensive speakers on the back seat of his Uber and sent an email to Uber later that day which said I should contact the driver.
I called the driver the next day and he said he’d drop the speakers off in the parking lot. I thought he meant the parking lot in front of my house where he picked me up originally but he meant a parking lot next to Chase bank? How was I supposed to assume this parking lot? I waited in my parking lot and he never showed. I had things to do so I figured it could wait and called back the next morning. We then agreed to meet at the parking lot next to Chase at 11 and that I’d call him when I’m over there. I went to the parking lot and he wasn’t there so I called several times from 11-1120. He finally picked up and told me he was busy. I called back at about 1215 and he said he was in the parking lot so I told him I’d be there in 5 min. I showed up and he wasn’t there so I called several times over the next 10 minutes and he never answered.
Thus, I reported this incident to Uber corporate and Uber corporate says he told them he doesn’t have any speakers. Uber told me that they would help with police inquiries. I told Uber corporate to let him know that I would file a police report if he didn’t return my speakers in 24 hours. I called the driver the next morning and he changed his story on me and told me what he was trying to tell me is that he didn’t find any speakers even though he said he had them and could drop them off? I asked why did he tell me he had them and he said something like “Why would I want your speakers?” Therefore, I filed a police report that night and the police called him through Uber a couple times and he hung up on the police twice. This happened a few months ago and Uber has not offered anything to attempt to make things right after I contacted them several times.

Someone stole my car on Father's day, June 19th. So my aunt suggested I use Uber. I'm in medical school with one more year to go. My school is 5.5 miles away from my house. On Tuesday morning June 21 I requested Uber, the trip cost 9.97. To get back home it was 9.98. Ok I was cool with that. But on Thursday morning it was 17.87. I didn't expect that. I told everybody who would listen at my medical school and many people had the same story. Advice I got was to just get up a little earlier and get a cab the fare will be 7 dollars. Three days of coming and going with Uber I am 60 dollars in. One of my schoolmates felt for me and offered me a ride home Thursday."

Three time is one week I had to fight them on so called ""guarantees"". First on a guarantee for referring passengers which I sent approximately 7 emails back & forth before they upheld their simply $20 guarantee and also twice for a special weekend guarantee where they wanted as many drivers on the road and promised a specific amount of money which not only did they not back up, I had to go back and forth again with them on it. If they upheld their policies, I'd give them 5 stars. The people you meet, drivers and riders are awesome. Unfortunately, the company lies constantly. What a shame."

We reached out to Uber who told my son who was in the car at the time of the accident that an adjuster would be coming out to assess the damages. We have never heard from them again.

I had 6-7 free rides which I was rewarded by referring my friends. Yesterday I referred one of my friend and she received first free ride and took a ride. I received a mail stating that I have earned free ride of 125/-. I then booked a cab in Uber but when I reached my destination I was charged the whole amount. I opened the app after paying the driver and saw there was no free rides available for me whereas day before yesterday I saw 6 free rides which were not expired also. I immediately mailed to customer help and they replied that I have misused my account to get a free ride. This is ridiculous. 
In free ride option in the main menu it's written if we want free rides then refer a friend and we will be rewarded with a free ride and after doing so they are saying I have misused the service and the system cannot detect the situation and my rides were cancelled. It's clear that there is something wrong in the system and due to which we suffer. The customer service is very poor they don't reply to the mails. I hope I will get back my free rides which I deserve it.

I drive four fares for Uber. People please; don't go into this business. I've read some poor people actually buy newer cars in order to drive on Uber?! You have got to do your math. Decisions like that have to be done educatedly. I live in Jacksonville, FL where the average rate is .75 cents per mile. Uber ONLY pays a driver while the rider is having the ride to their destination. The IRS values every mile you ride in your car at about 55 cents. That is the cost for gas and wear and tear on your vehicle. Then comes the driving you do to the point where your rider is; and after you drop your rider off to the next rider. Uber does not reimburse a cent for that. So your actual revenue is less than 20 cents per mile. That could be about 2.00 dollars per hour. It's way less than minimum federal wage.
I learned also about the surge price during peak hours. The rider suffers that and the driver never gets to see a fraction of that money. I urge people to please don't waste your money and your automobiles to do a job which is making someone else rich. Call your friends to drive you around or a taxi. Please understand that you’re risking your personal property as well as your safety too! That is with the consideration of being paid so little. I've actually read about some drivers who were charged by Uber. What in the world! Stop this CRIME.

I called Uber this morning to schedule a pick-up. When the driver arrived, the name on his I.D. was different from the name given me during scheduling. He said he needed to have payment in cash ($8.00). As I was going to be late for a doctor's visit, I paid him the cash. Uber then charged my bank account for the fare. I have tried to reach Uber numerous times, numerous ways, with no response. A customer service phone number instructs me to contact them online.

On April 9, 2016 at 1:00 am I requested a car from lower Manhattan to Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn which is a long ride. I watched as the map showed the car getting closer and only 1 minute away. I waited for another 10 minutes but the driver never showed. Then the driver canceled the ride. I tried again and another car was coming and never showed. Also the app showed the driver around the corner a minute away. After 10 more minutes I canceled. My friend who was with me requested a car from lower Manhattan to the Upper East Side in Manhattan and guess what, the driver showed. Uber charged me two cancellation fees and I had to take the subway at 1:30 am for an hour and a half to Brooklyn.
Uber customer service would not understand that the drivers dodged my requests so they would not have to go to Brooklyn and they insisted I was impatient. I think waiting 30 minutes was enough for a car parked one minute away. So the drivers suck, the service sucks and customer service sucked. Until I tried to cancel my account. I did get my money back.

I have noticed in the past months a serious decline in Uber service. Drivers are incredibly unprofessional. For example, today I was late to work so I requested an Uber. A driver accepted my request and the app showed he was just 3 minutes away. As I am waiting, I see the car move away from my location instead of closer. I call the driver, who tells me he is coming around. After waiting another 8 minutes, and seeing he is indeed coming around, he suddenly- and for no reason - cancels the trip when he is just a half block away. 
I called him and he didn't pick up the phone. I submitted a complaint to Uber but nobody got in touch with me. If I have cancelled a trip 5 minutes after requesting it, I would have been charged. In this occasion, I not only was late to work but nobody offered any compensation or apology. This is not the only time I've had an experience like this. Uber should hold their drivers accountable for such behaviour. I only hope that competitors would show up to offer a better and more reliable service.

Noticed activity on my iPhone today saying that my Uber ride was en route - well that was interesting as I was working from home and had not called Uber so I cancelled it without thinking anything was wrong. Went to drive my car to yoga and a new message comes up about my Uber driver is en route! Now I am curious so I go into my account and see that there were several rides since midnight - one for nearly $500. the interesting part was they were in Detroit and I am in Atlanta and had not been to Detroit in over six months and I always rent a car when there. In any case I send a message that I think there has been fraudulent activity and briefly explain what is going on - no response nothing! So I call the driver that is supposedly picking me up and tell him that I am in ATL that this is a fraudulent ride - he hangs up on me. 
I cancel that ride. I send another message to Uber saying fraudulent activity as the guy I just spoke to went on another ride - this time for over $100. Still nothing from Uber. So now I send a message about the issue I had with the ride saying fraudulent activity. They send me a note saying issue resolved and here's $5 for not being satisfied with my ride!! Really??! Now I have to spend 20 minutes on the phone with American Express going through all my Uber rides to say which ones are valid and which ones are fraudulent. There is no phone number for customers to reach out for this type of behavior. Their customer service is horrible and quite frankly, I wonder how safe we are as passengers with the caliber or lack thereof of people who are driving - what kind of background checks are these drivers put through??

This past Friday, May 13, 2016 at 4:40 p.m., I wanted to try the new UBER app to order a car. It was raining and I am disabled. I followed all the instructions on the APP 1. pickup location 224 West 57 Street & Broadway 2) destination, Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn. etc. and they sent me the name of the driver and you can see how far away he is from your location. I was waiting for the price of the ride which I thought should be automatically; some kind of confirmation number so I can have the option to not accept the car. The driver came and I figured he would know, as soon as I told him where I had to go, he was complaining that the trip was too far, a lot of traffic for Friday and it is raining. I asked him how much is the ride. He had no idea, but he kept saying to me it is an estimated price. There is no set price. That was not what I expected, so I asked what will the estimate be he said up to $200.00 due to the rain, heavy traffic. 
I couldn't believe what he told me. He literally threw me out of the cab. I said to drop me off at 57 Street & 7th Ave. because I was not going to pay such a fee. So by the time I was on the train I checked my bank account and UBER Charged me for a ride that I didn't take for $139.00. If I took any yellow cab, it would have been no more than $60 to $80 dollars. There is no way to reach them by phone, no specific person to e-mail to, just a support service. No mailing address, now they disconnected my cell phone off the app so I can't see if they reviewed my ride. I was robbed of $139.00 by this company. If you can let the public know about what happened to me, I would be very glad. At this point I don't know what else to do. I guess this is capitalism at work, start up a company with no control, and the drivers can do whatever they want. I am so upset.

I took a 13.00 fare to pick up a car for my company. I had all of my stuff, which included 2 phones. As soon as the driver left I realized I forgot 1 of the phones which I with android device manager while emailing both he and Uber support 7 times each over the course of the next hour. The driver answered his phone once and obviously knew I was calling about my phone as the Uber automated system tells him that when it auto calls. He hung up and then did not answer again for another hour. Uber responded back with ""wait a while"". After the hour of trying I texted and left a VM that simply said, ""I know you have my phone because I can see it on GPS, please call me back."" Well this moron obviously is not aware of gps technology and probably figured he was caught so he called me back. The conversation was unintelligible as he repeated over and over that he wasn't in my city any longer and couldn't get right back. 
I mentioned that he was in the city the first hour I called, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt - I understand a passenger leaving an item is a bit of a pain in the ass for a driver. My plan was to throw him some cash for his trouble and I even offered for him to put on the meter for his time up and back home to expedite the process. He said in 30 mins from that time he would be on the way. 5 more emails to Uber with all this info - response - ""can you be more specific"". After another hour I call and his phone is now straight to VM and has been ever since. My phone has also turned off either due to battery or the idiot driver. Still not even a whisper from Uber.
To add insult to injury - I am an Uber driver!!! I would never do this to someone. I don't understand what type of person would jeopardize their ability to earn income over a cell phone. You can make that money in a couple of hours. With that said, it's obvious that Uber has no standards regarding their drivers, so they probably won't ever make contact or penalize him. They probably are creating a new service called ""Uber hot"" where they sell off all the items that get left behind and the drivers get a cut. I don't have the ability to give 0 stars, but that is definitely my recommendation. I am totally grossed out with the level of concern I received from Uber, which is ZERO.

The truth is that Uber sucks. What we need is serious improvement on the taxi system rather than replacing it with a gigantic corporation that has way, waaay too much power in a unregulated market. Uber is too big to be controlled and that is a serious threat workers and consumers. I had an important medical appointment yesterday. I'm being treated with scheduled shots for a serious medical condition. The Uber driver who was supposed to pick me up cancelled the trip because of surging prices. Each and every time I tried to get an Uber car it was the same thing. The app showed the car arriving in a few minutes, but you could see the car taking turns and driving around to have me cancelling the trip and allowing him to make more money on another trip due to surging rates. It has happened many times in the past and the internet is full of negative reviews stating the very same problem, which I've heard from friend in Brazil as well.
Uber automated customer service is designed to look like a real person is responding to the endless number of complaints and taking no action. After a few passionate messages from my end, Uber sent me 5 dollars as a refund. Refund for what? That did not prevent the problem from happening again. In essence it fixes nothing and aggravates me even more. Be aware of the scam! Uber is not cheaper than a cab. This is simply not true. In addition, making a video to be watched online is not training drivers. This claim that drivers are better prepared than regular cab drivers is pure **.
I've been picked up in Miami by a driver who was riding with her mother on the passenger's seat. I nearly lost my flight as the driver had the nerve to stop at a Walgreens to buy snacks and got lost on her way to the airport. You may argue that it is the driver's fault. Not Uber's. Well, this is another reason why a multi-billion dollar corporation is scamming the world without being held accountable for anything. You did not use the driver's app. You contract Uber and the company does nothing for you when things go wrong. Don't help drivers in trouble, don't help consumers being disrespected. Be aware of the scam! I'm never using Uber again. Have asked repeatedly to have my account deleted and guess what? They haven't claiming that they will do it at their own terms.

My interaction with UBER support has turned out to be very unprofessional with an unfair final decision leading me to ask how can anyone count on such company to stand up for their well being and safety as a partner. UBER will not assist his partners in any safety incidents but rather take a step back and cut all ties whenever you as a partner find yourself in a situation that would qualify to be dangerous for your safety. I got assaulted, got some weird smelly liquid sprayed inside my car with no idea of what it was, a bottle thrown at me, my car kicked by that same rider (luckily there wasn't any dents), and then when I call the safety line to report the incident, my account got terminated for having to physically remove that rider when she tries to jump back inside my car while I am not even in it.

I have been using them for a while and it was great. However, recently I noticed that they are charging me at their own free wish and disregard my numerous concern or question to help. These are some of my observation on my recent use: App shows they are 1 minute away, so you click on them to pick you, then they won't show off until 15 to even 30 minutes (in freezing cold winter, snowy or rainy days).
If you cancel them to order another cab (since they don't show off, and they don't pick up phone after 15 or 30 minutes), then they charge you $5 anyways for cancellation fees, regardless of the driver's behavior, or corrupted system they have designed to charge people. So basically, they make you wait and wait under sunshine or cold weather and you are stuck with them to show off no matter how long it might take! Customers don't matter at all.
We got charged with the wrong address and wrong timing. In other word, they sent me invoice with incorrect timing and direction (than what it was in fact). This so happened when using Uber with colleagues, so everyone got to know how corrupted and careless they are. Robbery in daylight! One driver threw me out in snowy cold icy day and in the middle of a large puddle of mud!!! He cared less and just wanted to rush to the next $$!
I shared my concerns - especially being charged incorrectly by them/drivers - no luck so far! they care less! I do have pictures of my conversation with the driver (time is documented in the text msg, along with our concern of freezing weather and that we are out off the street waiting on him!), along with the receipt of being charged by Uber/driver falsely (with incorrect time of dire) to add couple of $ more!

I have been in business for myself for over 30 years and started driving for Uber at the behest of my wife and daughter, who thought I would have fun driving for them. I told them that I thought it was ridiculous to treat your personal car as a cab hauling people around with all costs of operation including risk on your own back, then UBER taking 25% plus riders fee as their take for virtually doing nothing except using their software. A truly incredible business model though...for them to get rich, not you...ever. No one was ever able to explain to me if it actually made dollar sense to drive, so I took a one month part time challenge driving 70 hours total on some weekdays and some weekends. Don't believe the liars who say they make $1,500 a week or more. They would have to work non-stop to even come close, and even then, the other costs that Uber takes and the cost of maintenance, insurance, gas, etc. would make that evaporate. 
Based on AAA costs of operating a motor vehicle for a mid-sized four-door sedan driving 20,000 per year (you will double that with Uber) the cost is at $0.48 per mile which includes gas, maintenance, insurance, depreciation, financing (unless you own outright) tire wear and tear, and several other factors. I did long airport runs and short city runs (longer runs make more $) and drove 2,142 miles over 3 1/2 weeks in April 2016 making a total after Uber cuts of $1,076.82. The AAA based that $0.48 on $2.85 gas which is more like $2.00 now, so take that into account now which would put operating costs today at 30% lower for FUEL ONLY and not the other expenses, so let's put it at $0.42 instead of $0.48. This is pretty simple math, so look at the facts. Instead of $1,030 cost to operate at driving 2,142 miles it will be $900 because of $2.00 gas. 
I made $1,076.82 before taxes and my operating costs were $900 giving me a net total of $176.82 for 70 hours of work. Now my car is paid off and will have lower depreciation, but that is about $2.53 per hour after expenses if your car is newer and not paid off. They tout you can make $16-$20-$30 an hour. In the REAL world you are actually making $1.60-$2.00-$3.00 per hour. I hope this helps people who have never been in business and who UBER and LYFT and any other companies out there that take advantage of others to get rich. These people will win in the end though and will be laughing all the way to the Bahamas when the scam runs to the end. Hope this helps anyone who does not just want to do this for fun, but thinks you can pay your bills with this ""job"".

I have been using Uber religiously for 2-3 months now. Everyone had bad things to say about not trusting them, but because I had mostly good experiencing I defended them, UNTIL! They started to charge you however they feel, the app says if you cancel 5 mins after you've requested, you get charged, fair enough! But I have requested and wasn't happy with my wait time and cancelled within seconds and was charged. On 3 occasions this happened, fortunately they credit back my account. Once, a driver cancelled on me because he PREFERRED a trip to downtown Toronto, I got charged for that. They refunded it too after I disputed it.
I've have complained way too many times about the wait times, 15-20 mins in my bust area because the pro of driver's flexibility is also a con, because they work when they want to which decreases the reliability of an Uber when needed. Today was my last straw with Uber because I can only imagine when they get the full 100 from the city to carry on with their business fully without taxi drivers complaining. I requested my Uber as normal and got my wait time of 11 mins, that's fine, 5 mins before my driver arrive they send me notice that my surge price is 1.3. I NEVER ACCEPTED SURGE PRICE. I screen shot this immediately and send to them. They start to explain surge pricing and how it works. I KNOW HOW IT WORKS! I've used it many times! They refuse to refund me, mind you, had I cancel that trip, I would of been charged $5 because they sent way past 5 mins.
My two cents, stick to regular taxi's because (1) You can depend on Uber when drivers decide to work they want. You'll be late to your destination; (2) If it's raining or snowing or the Sun is too HOT, drivers do not want to come out unless the price is surged, which means you end up waiting 5-10 mins and you pay the price you would pay for a regular cab. The point of a cab is reliability when time is against you. Uber removes that when their drivers work when they want and only in extreme condition when the price is surged.

I've been using Uber regularly for about a year now. I have had only positive experiences so far, except for one instance when a driver tried to scam me. She accepted my request, and a minute or so later, the app status suddenly changed to ""on trip."" I thought this was very strange and assumed perhaps there was a glitch or maybe the driver had accidentally hit the wrong button, so I canceled and requested again. I was connected to the same driver, but surely enough the app said I was on my way after a few moments. Again, I wanted to give my driver the benefit of the doubt and I chalked it up to the fact that I haven't updated Uber yet. However, I noticed that her car was starting to move along the route toward my destination. Interesting. I thought maybe she was trying to turn somewhere, but she just kept going, and it became clear that she was going to take me where I wanted to go without me in the car at all.
So I immediately canceled that ride. A few minutes later I got emails showing that I'd been charged for both ""trips."" So I used Uber's Help tool to dispute the charges, and fortunately, after just a few minutes I was refunded once with my actual money and once with Uber credit. So I'm at least glad that I immediately got my refund.
So, yeah, take from this what you will. Uber is generally safe and reliable, but like in any field or profession, there are going to be some bad people. The best thing you can do is be aware of the kinds of scams drivers may try to pull, including: planting fake vomit in the car and having you charged for it, Not ending the ride after you arrive at your destination, so the app continues to charge you after you've exited the car, Claiming you had multiple other passengers in the vehicle with you so they can charge extra, Starting the ""trip"" without picking you up.
It seems like Uber has gotten better about addressing complaints and issuing refunds, so that's good, but it helps to be aware that these things can happen. The sooner you report it, the better. But after dozens of rides in the past year that were perfectly fine, I'm still very satisfied with my service. All of the other drivers I've had have been at the very least pleasant, and some of them have been exceptionally polite and helpful - I've had many drivers help me unload groceries and carry them to my door, and I've had people pick me up for rides of less than 1 mile when I injured my ankle, even though drivers get paid very little to make small trips like that.
So, if you're reading these reviews, please just keep in mind that people usually take to these places to complain, so the results are going to be very skewed toward the negative side. I'm glad that sites like this exist so people CAN complain and warn others when things go wrong, but just take them with a grain of salt.

I called Uber to go home, usually I get charged less than $5. Yesterday night after work I called an UBER. I noticed that the driver took a different route, I even asked him and he said the GPS was telling him the direction. I got home and got charged $6.12. No problem, everything was fine. Then today, I got an email saying that the driver miscalculated the mins or whatever so I got charged additional $20.40. I AM SO UPSET! I FEEL SCAMMED BY SOMETHING I TRUSTED for 2 years. Please don't ride UBER anymore. Some drivers are greedy and want money out of their passengers. Too bad he scammed the wrong person. I am not stopping until I get my money back.

My best friend was driving for Uber, mostly on busy nights, when the rates were high, and when the surge area was busy, so I went with her a few times, so she feels safe. They ripped my friend off with her getting paid. Emailed her and said passengers complained and said she seemed intoxicated, and driving too fast, and speeding, which is Not true.
So at that time when we had no idea what was going on at that moment, Uber turned off her Uber app, and sender us to another rider's home to pick up for 20 mins or so. At the same time this rider is complaining asking her where she is. After us waiting and she receives these false complaints from Uber about the drunk driving and driving drunk and telling her they will cancel her account at the same time driving all that way, and went for 2 riders.
The one cancelled and she said that we are taking too long and the other we waited for 20 minutes and the guy never showed up. And at the same time she was getting mean comments from this man and overturned off her application. We had no idea what was going on it after we drove all that way, and then we decided to be done for the night because we don't know why that we were at was off and driving all that way back and forth a couple times and getting cussed out from other writers because of uber.
Also she's also trying to call them and she couldn't even get a hold of them and they have not even contacted her to tell her any of that information. They only email her. There is no type of business at all. If that's how they work I am never going to use Uber. Also heard that they have a GPS on their phone and they could track every move you make and see what you're doing at all times and know exactly where you are and don't care about what right if it's in the car and rips people's credit cards off. And my friend never got paid for what she did that night and some countless other times. They need to go out of business. You can't even contact them. They're ripping off his credit card and they only take certain types of credit cards. This is a horrible company and they need to go out of business.

On the evening of 5th April 2016 I called for an Uber car to take me from Dallas/Fort Worth airport to the west side of Fort Worth. I had just come in on a flight from California. Betty showed up in a white Mitsubishi Gallant. She lives in Irving and works the mid-cities area. We traveled to my destination and had pleasant and polite conversation on the way. I sat in the front of the car. Soon after the ride was complete I was informed that my ride was $46.43 which was reasonable for the distance traveled. The next day I received a tag on fee of $200 to cover clean-up of vomit on the front seat of the car. I checked on Google to find that the vomit scam is alive and well and apparently 'Uber Betty' is using this to screw her passengers and boost her income. I was emailed bogus pictures of my vomit.
Uber were useless in assisting with this claim as they are all but unable to be contacted. It was PayPal that reversed the charge after I filed a complaint with them. I would urge you that if you use Uber, take photographs of the front and back seats and the license plate of the car to protect yourself from being scammed like I was. I would further advise you that if 'Uber Betty' arrives in her white Mitsubishi Gallant, run like hell. She will screw you and you might not be as lucky as me in getting your money back.

I tried to use Uber for the first time today and what a joke. The Android App is the most amateur and unusable app I've ever seen. Seriously. Who designed it? It is completely not logical, follows few if any standards, completely non-intuitive. I seriously wonder if you need to take drugs to understand how to use it. I'm not even joking. Head meds, crack cocaine - something. The website is even worse. The absolutely least user friendly and non-functional website I have ever seen from a company larger than 5 employees. What's up with that? Then, if you get through all of that, which takes a roughly 2 hour learning curve because the app makes no sense until you start trying random things - it only accepts certain KINDS of credit cards. It wants bank cards so it can presumably drain your bank account at will, but rejects secure cards that limit the damage criminal companies like Uber can do. That's nice.
Last, there is no explanation anywhere of the terms. You have to scour the web and go to forums unless you can guess the made-up terms they use. I wish New Mexico's G Ride would go national - it is INFINITELY better. I absolutely do not trust Uber, am deleting my credit card info, and keeping a close eye to make sure they don't steal from me because I have absolutely no confidence in them based on their sheer incompetence.

I was a driver for Uber. I kept a record of my trip history from, which included the time I received the call for pick-up, the time of pick-up, the time of drop-off and what the mileage was when I picked up and dropped off the rider. When I reviewed my trip history with what Uber paying me for, I discovered that there was substantial difference in mileage that from my car, and Uber is showing. Some trips were short, over 3 miles! Uber refused to pay me for all the discrepancies I showed them. One trip they charged the customer for, but didn't pay me anything! Thank God I kept a detailed record off what I did. I was cheated out of 38 miles of travel. I could go on but I am using a library-timed computer.
Updated 4/7/2016 - Just reviewed my pay statement from Uber, and once again, I am totally convinced that they are totally unethical and outright dishonest, putting it lightly. As I stated in my last complaint, there was one ride I wasn't even paid for. I went to Uber last week with my list 16 discrepancies, wherein each discrepancy was about the mileage that I recorded from start to finish, vs what Uber was showing and paying me on. 
The Uber rep told me, regarding the ride I wasn't paid for, that they charged the customer $25.08, which I noted on my list, and that they would make an adjustment for that, and it would appear on my next statement. However, upon reviewing my pay statement, they are showing that they charged the customer $19.08!! They also completely changed the numbers on another trip that originally showed $9.55 fare down to $5.20! It was showing I would get $7.16 of the $9.55, but now shows only $3.90, based on the revised $5.20 fee! 
I guess they don't think people screen their pay statements, but I do, and I happened to make a copy of the statement before the numbers were changed, thus I was able to capture how they changed the figures. I really wish someone would audit them and verify if what they are charging the customer, whether they are paying the driver their fair share. Based on what has happened to me, on the trip I had been told what they charged the rider $25.08 and what they put on my statement ($19.08) is absolute proof they are not honest, as well as the other issue.

I raised multiple complaints in 10-15 mins on UBER app. Until now (even after 20 hours) I did not get any response or call from them. Thus, there is not credibility or authenticity.
Being a local Hyderabadi resident, I could deal with this abusive driver in my own way. But trust me, IT IS VERY UNSAFE TO USE UBER CAB SERVICE as you may not be able to question anyone if you get screwed. You don't have any authorization, I am not sure how government is allowing these services to run as even in the case of emergency, you do not have a local customer care number attached to it.

My experiences are mixed, with a couple of good rides, but on the whole were negative. Actual experiences: Bad - surge pricing has no upper limit. A trip which normally costs about $20 ended up costing almost $150 due to Uber's uncapped surge pricing policy. Uber has no city or government limit on prices, meaning that they can pretty much gouge what they want, as opposed to taxis who have rates limited by law. Often the surge pricing does not reflect the reality of what the demand and cost actually are out in the streets, extending beyond the actual ""surge"" in demand in order to add a little extra.
Bad - A trip was in a vehicle which was so poorly maintained that all the warning lights on the dashboard were flashing, and the vehicle was noticeably shaking/swerving. The driver was struggling to keep the vehicle in the lane, narrowly avoiding collisions with other vehicles. I was literally in fear of my life. Bad - When pooling with another rider, a driver refused to take us the most economical (and fastest) route, driving about 12 miles out of the way (and past one of the destinations twice) telling us that the Uber management had told him to go by the GPS route and could not deviate from it in anyway, getting angry with us when we pointed out the cost benefits of decent route planning.
Good - A friend was drunk had had to be shipped home, (in return for a good tip) the Uber driver called us to let us know she had been dropped off safely and that she had made it inside her apartment without issue. Good - Pickup times are ok, usually I can get an Uber within 15 to 20 minutes of ordering. Bad - Drivers accept trips and then cancel ten minutes later, leaving you stuck to order again. This seems to happen a lot at the cusp of ""surge"" pricing times, meaning the pre-surge price you originally ordered at is now increased.
Bad - Even though drivers can cancel without reason or at the last minute at no cost to the driver, Uber charges passengers a cancellation fee. Bad - Even though city ordinances for ground transportation are clear, in that Uber could (if it wanted) operate entirely legally with only minor administration costs, a notarized application and a city bond, Uber has decided that obeying the law is not acceptable, and is fighting to get the law changed. Odd that small companies can follow the law, pay fees and bonds, and make a profit, but a multinational corporation can't seem to find the time or money to complete a little paperwork.
Mixed - Some Uber drivers have excellent navigation skills and know the city well, knowing the back routes past traffic and obstructions, others seem to be unable to read a map, follow GPS or listen to route suggestions from long-term residents, some seem unable to even use their eyes and read road signs, whilst at least two drivers I have had have been able to get lost finding their way around a small parking lot.

A request for a UBER driver roughly on Feb 6th 2016 to pick me up at Wal-mart. According to the driver it would take her about 10 minutes to arrive at my location. When she didn't show, I called her for her ETA. She asked if I was in LA Mirada which was about 20 minutes away. I was in Stanton. Then she said that she had another pickup and had to cancel mine. On Feb 8 UBER took out $5.00 from my checking account saying it was for a no show... For a no show? How can it be a no show when the driver never showed. I called UBER and told them about it and they reimbursed the $5.00 but then on the same day took out the $5.00 again. 
I emailed them again asking for the refund. They asked for my card number and other info. Today is Feb 15 and NO REFUND. Why should I pay for something I never received. I told them to cancel my account and reimburse the $5.00. Now UBER is saying that they can't give me my money back because I closed my account. All of this problem began on Feb 8 (7 days before I asked them to close the account). I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN. I am also asking my friends who use UBER to cancel their accounts with the company.

I missed an important meeting at work because I had to walk a few miles in the middle of nowhere. This is because Uber would not work. They were updating the icon on the smartphone, which took an hour. I could not use the app while they were updating this icon. Absolutely absurd. They are losing customers because of silly updates like that. At least I have a pretty icon I can look at on my phone. They won't get my business again. It's back to calling taxis."

Sunday January 31st, I requested Uber with 2 friends to go home. It was surge pricing 4.3x, which was fine, considering my drop off location (my apartment) was only 7 miles away. The driver arrives, picks us up, then we drive home, get dropped off. Everything is fine up until this point. Next day I checked my phone, never got any type of email receipt (usually I get them immediately after I get dropped off) so I begin to think they didn't charge me. 
Several days go by, and still no receipt then comes Thursday, February 5th, I receive the receipt. Are you ready?? For $424.08!! At my shock, I immediately file a claim with UBER via email, since they don't even have a phone number. I explained to them my story and they said we need to hear the driver's story. They emailed me back and said, that I instructed the driver to drive 2 other passengers to 2 other drop off points 80 miles away. This is a blatant lie, as my 2 passengers got off with me at the drop off point. 
After I hear this absurd story, completely fabricated by the driver, who just wanted to run up the meter, I become outraged. UBER is taking the word of a con-artist thief driver, over a loyal customer of several years. I want to file suit against UBER since they are not cooperating with me. I was basically robbed of $424.08.

I downloaded the app and tried out a promotion to give me $22 dollars off our first ride, since it was our first time in Miami, we decided to use it. After waiting almost 45 minutes the driver said she picked us up and dropped us off in 5 seconds. Not only did she waste my time but my promo code. My fiance and I decided to give them a try again, this time he said he wanted to do everything. So he created an account and used the same promo code. The app stated it took it, after the ride was over, it sent us a bill and said if there is a problem contact customer service. It was only $14, but when we contacted customer service, Rachelle basically said we didn't put in a promo code so she refused to help us. Not only are the drivers terrible but the customer service is even worse. STAY AWAY from Uber. I tried Lyft after a friend recommended it, and honestly it's 1000x better! Good honestly people!"

I had 12 fraudulent charges by Uber against my American Express account, including two that used membership rewards points. Total was more than $2,500. There were no other fraudulent charges on the card and AE removed the charges and restored the rewards points. As I understand it, there's no way this could have been done by Uber drivers. I expect it is the result of hacking of user accounts in the United States.

I had good experience with Uber in the past, but the couple of times I requested an Uber late at night, I got harassed by the drivers. They always flirt and comment inappropriately about the clothes I am wearing, the smell of my perfume, how good I look, which makes me very uncomfortable. Lately, I requested an Uber and the driver yelled at me over the phone for not being able to locate where exactly he is parked in a very big intersection and then refused to give me a ride after I already got in the car. Not only that, but he also got out of his car, chased me in the street, and cursed me for failing to close his car door properly.
I contacted Uber and all they did was telling me that they will look into it, but they never mentioned the action they took against that particular driver and how they intend to prevent this nonstop harassment of Uber drivers to women. We get charged a safe ride fee and being harassed by male drivers does not really seem safe to me. On the other hand, Uber responded fast when I contacted them via e-mail and the person who contacted me offered an apology.

Even armed with a police report, Uber has done nothing to help resolve the matter.

I used to be a regular Uber user until now. I recently used Uber in Long Beach. I ordered a vehicle at an agreed upon price. When the driver pulled up there were four other people that wanted to share the ride. I asked the driver if this was ok and he said ""no problem"" as he was going to the same place anyway. These were colleagues that were also going to the cruise port so I told them that I would take care of the fare. Once we got there, they gave the driver a very generous tip not realizing the tip was include, but the driver had no problem accepting it. I got my receipt as I always do and then ten minutes later, I got another receipt with an additional 14.00 charge, which they charged my credit card. You can only email their customer service and after they got back to me 72 hours later the customer service rep told me the additional charge was for the extra people.
The driver never said a word to me about this and should have when I ask him if they could come. I told the customer service rep that I was going to dispute this and she emailed me back and said that if I dispute the charge my account will be canceled and I can never use Uber again. Of course I disputed it and the Capitol One rep stated that I did the right thing and my account was credited... I can care less that they would cut me off as why would I use the service of a company that was NOT authorized to charge my card. Watch out for these deceptive tactics and be wary of a company whose customer service dept can only be reached via email. I still have the email that Katy from customer service sent me.

If you want to save money, Do NOT rely on Uber! They will rip you off! I was lured into using Uber when they automatically sent me a promo code that offered $15 off my first ride and when I came across a promo code offering $18 off my first ride. I spent 15 or 20 minutes trying to apply the code when making arrangements to be picked up and the codes wouldn't even work. Uber sent the code that takes $15 off my first ride when I began making the arrangements and that code kept coming up as invalid too! Uber doesn't provide a phone number for you to call and they don't respond to email within 5 minutes. My driver said that another passenger had the same problem but the code eventually kicked in once they began their journey. 
My code never kicked in. I was advised by the driver to email Uber and the problem would be resolved. My ride should have come to $7.47 with the code but came to $25.47 instead. When I told Uber about this, I was given the runaround by Delia. In her first response, she asked which code(s) I tried to use and in her next, she said that the code has to be applied before the trip comes to an end, supposedly the code was applied after my trip and because of that they're unable to give me the deduction! This is a bunch of bull! It was my first trip and each time I tried to apply the code, it would come up as invalid even though it was my first trip! Save your money and use Lyft instead of Uber.

I recently moved to Orlando and my car ended up the shop shortly after. I decided to try Uber to get back and forth to work. I really like the app and how you can see where the driver is so I know when to leave out my apartment and meet them. But prior to my order I added two credit cards to my Uber account. One is a bank debit card the other is a prepaid debit card, both with VISA logos. Uber defaulted to the bank card for payment. However, I wanted to use the prepaid debit card but for some reason it wouldn't switch. My bank card didn't have the funds for the trip but it allowed the pre-authorization.
Well, after contacting customer service which you can only do via email, I learned that Uber doesn't accept prepaid debit cards as payments. WTH?! If taxis can, why not Uber? Lyft is the same way. Well PayPal also doesn't accept prepaid cards so I couldn't even pay that way. Since Uber and Lyft are apps that you can only pay by way of credit cards or bank debit cards, this gives taxis the edge in my opinion. Now I'll have no other option but to use cabs until I get my car out the shop. This sucks.

There are several things that annoy me about the Uber service in the Boston, MA area. (1) You cannot cancel an ordered drive when it becomes apparent that the driver of the car cannot seem to find where you are at despite phone calls and having past your drive area two to three times without having to pay for the cancellation because of the driver's outright ineptness. If I can track them as they pass by three times, so can The Uber network. It should be three times and you are out, period.
(2) I was on a ride this evening where the driver could not find where we were even though we say their car go by twice. The GPS kept telling her where to turn and she kept missing the turns. And this was more than likely because the driver had the radio up loud playing hip-hop music and they were just plain not paying attention despite the fact that we had to tell the driver where to go. So much for the Quiet, Clean, and Courteous rides. 
(3) On an average from the same spot that I normally have to catch a cab, Uber, or Lyft from, it takes 15 to 30 minutes for the drivers to show up. My experience with Lyfts is that they are usually there before I get out of the door of the building and in worse conditions, never have to wait more that 5 minutes max. (4) Many Uber drivers are also or have been taxi drivers, so you get taken for a ride either way. My complaint is a general one because I am getting fed up with poor service from those that brag that theirs is better than any other. Clearly it is not. At least not in Boston.

October 31st at 11:01 PM, we requested an Uber pickup in Fort Lauderdale, FL. Immediately we received a text that said since it was a busy time, there would be a surcharge and our fare would be 2x the normal amount. We agreed since it was Halloween and a busy time. 11:01 PM we received a text that Uber was arriving. Uber did not show up. We text Uber twice to let them know we were in front of a restaurant which is easy to find. 11:20 PM we called and spoke with the Uber driver who said he was in traffic and would be there in two minutes. 11:3 PM still no Uber driver. 
We hailed a taxi who did not charge us double and we cancelled the Uber trip. Uber emailed us to let us know that our credit card was charged $5 for cancellation. We went onto Uber account and let them know this was not acceptable. Uber customer service gave us a credit of $5 toward the next Uber trip, and would not refund the $5. Uber gives service that is only convenient for them. They surcharge during busy times and do not show up. If we accept businesses treating consumers like this, where will it end?? Are restaurants next to charge us double because we wish to dine at a busy time such as a Saturday night vs a slower Tuesday? This type of treatment is not acceptable.

I set up my account with Uber and willingly gave them my billing information. I only wanted a ride to and from work. Well, the first ride worked fine. A tad expensive but I was not crying. The return ride was not set with the company because the account set up didn't allow for it (I booked on my home based iPad). The driver said he would pick me up from work and I could pay him. Although a tad expensive this too worked out ok. 
The next day the horror began. The driver said he would pick me up and we could bypass Uber. He didn't show although I called him twenty times. I then called Uber. They told me they would come but it would cost three times the fare (fee would be over $120 to go less than ten miles). I was desperate and agreed. They never showed. The taxi company said they could come an hour later. I was going to be late for work and I started crying. A friend saved the day but by then I couldn't stop crying.

I recently had to take my dog to get her an appointment to get her shot. Everything went well and, as always, when I arrived back home from the doctors I checked behind my seat to see if me or my dog left a mess behind. Which we DID NOT. The next day I go to my local pet store with my family to buy her treats and my card is declined. Turns out Uber charged my card $200!! I asked them why was that money taken out and they said the driver sent a report that my dog urinated and left feces in his car. I knew he was either lying or got the ride. So I simply told them they made a mistake and if they could please refund me back my money. 
The lady sent me a photo of ""evidence"" of the mess left behind and I almost laughed and forgot how angry I was. (I pasted a photo of the evidence they sent me). I told them that is not feces. And if my dog would have used the bathroom in the car : 1. It would have stained. 2. It would have smelled right away. 3. She cannot pee in a car while laying down! I'm upset but I called my bank and they filed a claim and gave me back my money because Uber is not supposed to take that amount out without authorization. Do Not Trust Uber. You're better off using another company called Lyft :-)

Having checked out the so called opportunity for drivers, I decided it wasn't for me and notified them of my lack of interest. Then week after week letters from Uber came requesting my DL#, SS# and a block of personal information. I responded in writing that I had no interest in their company. Today, I received notice of adverse action, from their investigative services, stating that my application had been rejected because of my driving record. My driving record has been totally without blemish for 15 years. I do not know if someone is trying to steal my identity or what. Uber never answers my letters."

I'm visiting NYC and was attempting to get the attention of a taxi driver and a black Lincoln Continental pulls up with a sheet taped to the right window ""UBER"". The driver said he could take me the 1.5 miles to my destination. I told him I'm not signed up with UBER but heard the rates are better than a taxi. After getting to my destination, he told me the charge was $45 plus a tip and I said ""You've got to be kidding."" I asked him to show me how he came up with that and he said he does this everyday and knows the rates. He refused to provide a fare estimate and said the fare was based on what he normally charge. I told him I think his practice is illegal and he started to use profanity towards me while speaking very loud and threatened to call NYC when I asked for the fare estimate.
I told my friends about the experience after meeting them and they said the driver isn't supposed to take cash for fares because they get paid through the company. Needless to say, I'm extremely upset and will never ever trust this UBER invention again. However, I do hope to see the car again and the middle eastern driver. In addition, I'm going to file a report with the Attorney General, BBB, and other regulatory agencies.

This is a warning to anyone that uses Uber. On October 9, 2015 I used UberX to take me approximately 10 miles, downtown to the auto dealership on Howe Ave, to pick up my car from a scheduled service. My office is located on J street with ample parking in front. I put my pick up location in accurately, and saw on the Uber app that a car was 5 minutes away. I waited on the curb for the next 15 minutes, at which point I sent a text message to the driver. He never replied and cancelled the pickup shortly after. I was notified another driver would be at my location in 5 minutes.
The driver showed up after another 10 minutes. His car was an older Nissan, several dings and scratches on the exterior and the interior was dirty. The seats had several deep stains and the car smelled of cigarette smoke. He asked me as to my destination, I told him it was entered in the app. He said he didn't have it. Once he was set, which took another 5 minutes we were off. He was driving excessively fast down J street, at times we were doing 50 mph. That is nearly twice the speed limit. I asked him to slow down, then we ran a red light. I told him that I wanted out, he said he would slow down. At the first stop light, I exited his vehicle. To my shock, the trip in his car showed up as a 47.15 expense. That was for going no more than 3 miles. I contacted the customer support at Uber, explained my experience and they said I accepted a ""surge"" rate and I had no recourse.
I took down the driver's license plate number and called the CHP. The officer I spoke to said there was little they could do since they did not witness the violations. He did say that Uber drivers are not professionally trained, the cars can be unsafe and it is a ""rider beware"" scenario. As I understand it from reading up on Uber, I am not alone in these experiences. In addition, there are issues regarding the drivers insurance as well. I will never use Uber again, ever.

I signed up for UBER to start driving with them about a month ago. I have a 2015 vehicle and clean background and I am in the military. The background - it's been pending for 4 weeks and they still don't know what's going on. Since they don't have a customer service hotline. They just give any excuses. The background take about 7-10 days but then takes about an eternity. This is the worst experience I have had with an employer. It was a mistake - I shouldn't trust a company who doesn't have a human being to talk to. They said ""we'll take care of it and we'll see what's going on and we'll send you an email."" They never ever did. So I decided to cancel my account."

I started driving for Uber and have been doing it a couple of weeks. It took a while to get statements showing what I actually made in income versus what the fares were. Uber gets between 33% and 45% of the money, at the higher end on short trips, which are more common. And there is the waiting and drive time when you are off the clock! At least in my market (Twin Cities, MN) you are going to make about $10 to $13 an hour BEFORE EXPENSES. When you factor in gas, wear and tear on your car, tires, brakes, etc. you are likely making about $5 per hour! It is a fun job, flexible, interesting people, etc. But you can't make any money and you are using up your car. Uber is a great deal for the riders, and for Uber! I'm done with it."

I had an extremely terrible experience with Uber Drive today.. (9/27/15 9:30 PM PST) I was picked up by a WRONG Uber. I showed him the Driver Info and Name and he said it is correct and I am his ride. After driving a mile, he asked me to leave as I was not his ride as it showed up on his phone! I had lost power from my cell phone at that time! I tried to explain the situation but did not understand English at all. I requested him to drop me off at nearby safe place, he declined. I offered him to pay full price to drop me off at my home, he declined.
And I and my family (my wife and my little daughter) got stranded on the middle of the road. His Car License Plate was **. He could not even give me his name! So, how did I ended up in his car? He asked me to get in the car. I showed him Driver and Car Info. And he said yes. After driving a a mile he realized he had a wrong ride. So, he had no clue! I had to wait so late in the middle of a road, finally took a taxi. I am so upset that I have no words to describe my experience today. Why did Uber allowed non-English speaking drivers in USA? Why did he pick us up from a wrong location? Why did he not have any courtesy to drop us off to a decent place? I asked Uber customer service to help, they simply added 5$ refund on my account.. Uber Request id **. Very poor and highly unsafe service.. Especially if you are with family.

I had the most horrible experience this afternoon riding an Uber taxi to Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston. First of all, the exterior of the car was very dirty. The interior was no better, filth and grime was visible in the dashboard area. The car reeked of cigarette. When I asked the Driver if he had been smoking, all he did was fiddle with the A/C vents. After a while, he rolled down the window on his side slightly, I guess to reduce the cigarette smell, but that didn't really help. External heat and fumes came into the car, worsening the situation. I could hardly breathe and I developed a headache. My clothes still smell of cigarette.
The driver was distracted throughout the roughly 1 hour ride, he was constantly checking his phone. Furthermore, the driver was overspeeding, going at 60 - 70 mph, on roads that have speed limits of 55 - 60 mph. When I told him that I wasn't in a hurry, he insisted that he was driving within speed limits. This type of car and driver should not be on Uber fleet.

When I started they said I needed an IPhone so rented one through them not realizing there were more hidden fees behind the $10/week charge for it. I added my 32 trips to over $300 and only received ~$50 total which only covered the gas and tolls I spent out of my pocket. Maybe if I'd stayed until the phone was paid off I, as a part-time driver around my full-time job and other responsibilities... I would have seen a profit. As of now I drove all them rides for FREE.
I will never put myself through it again or long enough to find out. There was no number to speak with someone nor physical location. The one address I found was a 7-11 when I drove there. I can imagine the process they'd put me through to recover what's rightfully mine. Don't waste your time. With Lyft I see fair amounts deposited every week. I am so disturbed with my Uber driver experience, I took my precious time to stop and make sure this truth that part-time driver who have no IPhone and maybe all should be aware of.

Uber charges cleaning fees without investigating the accusations made by the driver. I had to repeatedly ask for more information requested a copy of the pictures (which I believe were fabricated). I was charged $100 cleaning fee for a wet seat (water ONLY). I filed a complaint with the BBB and read some other complaints that other customers had with Uber and came across a similar complaint. An Uber driver accused a customer of urinating in his car and was charged $200 cleaning fee. 
This issue is a little alarming because I was not provided with any pictures or an explanation for the cleaning fee and feel that as a consumer, I am unprotected by Uber drivers and their false accusations. I do not know what the driver told the company. In addition, I now fear that after a ride is completed, the Uber driver can soil the car and then blame the customer just to get extra cash.

I just need to access online to book a ride!
Stage 2. They claimed they could not locate my account. Then, don't tell me acct already existed, please reset password when I tried to logon. Stage 3. They finally find my account, but they need a picture of my Gov ID to email me a password reset email link. I told them I am NOT their driver.

March 2015 I took a trip to New York. A coworker suggested I try the Uber app. Trip one, the pick up at the airport, the driver was sitting in the wrong place and expected me to walk to him at the other end of the terminal. Trip 2 a short ride from my hotel was $20, when a yellow cab for the same trip was $8. The driver again stopped midway down the block and parked in front of another hotel. It took him 25 minutes to find me, when the APP showed his car making circles around the blocks nearby. Trip 3 the driver did not know where to go to find Broadway and Lafayette. Uber drivers use their personal cars to pick up a few fares. They don't know the normal taxi protocols, and it cost be double or more for each local ride. Yellow Cabs are still a great service, with professionals who may not have fancy black cars, but have expertise in driving."

I used Uber twice on a recent trip to Houston with mixed results. First I used an uberX ($12.88), to save money. The driver showed up and spoke poor English and his car was beat up. He was nice but didn't really know where we were going. Ultimately it worked out but the experience was like a mediocre to bad cab ride, though it cost a lot less.
Next I took a Black ($20) car. The car was nice, the driver knew where to go. (I got the nicer car since I was taking my date to dinner).
In the future I'd use a Black car where available, even though it was 55% more money. It's worth an extra $7 to have an actively good experience.

Maybe if I'd stayed until the phone was paid off I, as a part-time driver around my full-time job and other responsibilities... I would have seen a profit. As of now I drove all them rides for FREE.
I will never put myself through it again or long enough to find out. There was no number to speak with someone nor physical location. The one address I found was a 7-11 when I drove there. I can imagine the process they'd put me through to recover what's rightfully mine. Don't waste your time. With Lyft I see fair amounts deposited every week. I am so disturbed with my Uber driver experience, I took my precious time to stop and make sure this truth that part-time driver who have no IPhone and maybe all should be aware of.

I signed for Uber with the app but have never used the service. Since May of this year I have incurred a $171.52 of Uber charges on my account. Again, I have never used the Uber account. I have written at least 4 emails to Rebecca/Erik at Uber Support. Erik as he puts it has taken over the account because he believes the charges are a family member, that I given permission to. Uber's payment system is flawed, they're charging my account without permission!"

Uber charges cleaning fees without investigating the accusations made by the driver. I had to repeatedly ask for more information requested a copy of the pictures (which I believe were fabricated). I was charged $100 cleaning fee for a wet seat (water ONLY). I filed a complaint with the BBB and read some other complaints that other customers had with Uber and came across a similar complaint. An Uber driver accused a customer of urinating in his car and was charged $200 cleaning fee. 
This issue is a little alarming because I was not provided with any pictures or an explanation for the cleaning fee and feel that as a consumer, I am unprotected by Uber drivers and their false accusations. I do not know what the driver told the company. In addition, I now fear that after a ride is completed, the Uber driver can soil the car and then blame the customer just to get extra cash.

Uber drivers are very often lost. They don't find you, or their system locate you at a wrong location. When at first I liked Uber, I will not use them again for a doctor or important appointment. I was late and I missed too many appointment when they were late. They offer you to order a new driver, but by the time the other driver arrive, you are more late than you were.

Here is the summary of their staged response. Stage 1. I must press the wrong button after taking a ride to provide them a feedback about the services. Did I? I just need to access online to book a ride!
Stage 2. They claimed they could not locate my account. Then, don't tell me acct already existed, please reset password when I tried to logon. Stage 3. They finally find my account, but they need a picture of my Gov ID to email me a password reset email link. I told them I am NOT their driver.

March 2015 I took a trip to New York. A coworker suggested I try the Uber app. Trip one, the pick up at the airport, the driver was sitting in the wrong place and expected me to walk to him at the other end of the terminal. Trip 2 a short ride from my hotel was $20, when a yellow cab for the same trip was $8. The driver again stopped midway down the block and parked in front of another hotel. It took him 25 minutes to find me, when the APP showed his car making circles around the blocks nearby. Trip 3 the driver did not know where to go to find Broadway and Lafayette. Uber drivers use their personal cars to pick up a few fares. They don't know the normal taxi protocols, and it cost be double or more for each local ride. Yellow Cabs are still a great service, with professionals who may not have fancy black cars, but have expertise in driving."

I used Uber twice on a recent trip to Houston with mixed results. First I used an uberX ($12.88), to save money. The driver showed up and spoke poor English and his car was beat up. He was nice but didn't really know where we were going. Ultimately it worked out but the experience was like a mediocre to bad cab ride, though it cost a lot less.
Next I took a Black ($20) car. The car was nice, the driver knew where to go. (I got the nicer car since I was taking my date to dinner).
In the future I'd use a Black car where available, even though it was 55% more money. It's worth an extra $7 to have an actively good experience.

This is a warning to anyone that uses Uber. On October 9, 2015 I used UberX to take me approximately 10 miles, downtown to the auto dealership on Howe Ave, to pick up my car from a scheduled service. My office is located on J street with ample parking in front. I put my pick up location in accurately, and saw on the Uber app that a car was 5 minutes away. I waited on the curb for the next 15 minutes, at which point I sent a text message to the driver. He never replied and cancelled the pickup shortly after. I was notified another driver would be at my location in 5 minutes.
The driver showed up after another 10 minutes. His car was an older Nissan, several dings and scratches on the exterior and the interior was dirty. The seats had several deep stains and the car smelled of cigarette smoke. He asked me as to my destination, I told him it was entered in the app. He said he didn't have it. Once he was set, which took another 5 minutes we were off. He was driving excessively fast down J street, at times we were doing 50 mph. That is nearly twice the speed limit. I asked him to slow down, then we ran a red light. I told him that I wanted out, he said he would slow down. At the first stop light, I exited his vehicle. To my shock, the trip in his car showed up as a 47.15 expense. That was for going no more than 3 miles. I contacted the customer support at Uber, explained my experience and they said I accepted a ""surge"" rate and I had no recourse.
I took down the driver's license plate number and called the CHP. The officer I spoke to said there was little they could do since they did not witness the violations. He did say that Uber drivers are not professionally trained, the cars can be unsafe and it is a ""rider beware"" scenario. As I understand it from reading up on Uber, I am not alone in these experiences. In addition, there are issues regarding the drivers insurance as well. I will never use Uber again, ever.

I signed up for UBER to start driving with them about a month ago. I have a 2015 vehicle and clean background and I am in the military. The background - it's been pending for 4 weeks and they still don't know what's going on. Since they don't have a customer service hotline. They just give any excuses. The background take about 7-10 days but then takes about an eternity. This is the worst experience I have had with an employer. It was a mistake - I shouldn't trust a company who doesn't have a human being to talk to. They said ""we'll take care of it and we'll see what's going on and we'll send you an email."" They never ever did. So I decided to cancel my account."

I started driving for Uber and have been doing it a couple of weeks. It took a while to get statements showing what I actually made in income versus what the fares were. Uber gets between 33% and 45% of the money, at the higher end on short trips, which are more common. And there is the waiting and drive time when you are off the clock! At least in my market (Twin Cities, MN) you are going to make about $10 to $13 an hour BEFORE EXPENSES. When you factor in gas, wear and tear on your car, tires, brakes, etc. you are likely making about $5 per hour! It is a fun job, flexible, interesting people, etc. But you can't make any money and you are using up your car. Uber is a great deal for the riders, and for Uber! I'm done with it."

I had an extremely terrible experience with Uber Drive today.. (9/27/15 9:30 PM PST) I was picked up by a WRONG Uber. I showed him the Driver Info and Name and he said it is correct and I am his ride. After driving a mile, he asked me to leave as I was not his ride as it showed up on his phone! I had lost power from my cell phone at that time! I tried to explain the situation but did not understand English at all. I requested him to drop me off at nearby safe place, he declined. I offered him to pay full price to drop me off at my home, he declined.
And I and my family (my wife and my little daughter) got stranded on the middle of the road. His Car License Plate was **. He could not even give me his name! So, how did I ended up in his car? He asked me to get in the car. I showed him Driver and Car Info. And he said yes. After driving a a mile he realized he had a wrong ride. So, he had no clue! I had to wait so late in the middle of a road, finally took a taxi. I am so upset that I have no words to describe my experience today. Why did Uber allowed non-English speaking drivers in USA? Why did he pick us up from a wrong location? Why did he not have any courtesy to drop us off to a decent place? I asked Uber customer service to help, they simply added 5$ refund on my account.. Uber Request id **. Very poor and highly unsafe service.. Especially if you are with family.

I had the most horrible experience this afternoon riding an Uber taxi to Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston. First of all, the exterior of the car was very dirty. The interior was no better, filth and grime was visible in the dashboard area. The car reeked of cigarette. When I asked the Driver if he had been smoking, all he did was fiddle with the A/C vents. After a while, he rolled down the window on his side slightly, I guess to reduce the cigarette smell, but that didn't really help. External heat and fumes came into the car, worsening the situation. I could hardly breathe and I developed a headache. My clothes still smell of cigarette.
The driver was distracted throughout the roughly 1 hour ride, he was constantly checking his phone. Furthermore, the driver was overspeeding, going at 60 - 70 mph, on roads that have speed limits of 55 - 60 mph. When I told him that I wasn't in a hurry, he insisted that he was driving within speed limits. This type of car and driver should not be on Uber fleet.

I have a pending transaction of $156 and $75 from Uber. This was quite the sticker shock when this trips should have only cost $30 each. Neither of which were approved on my card. I have been back and forth all weekend trying to get this situation resolved. I have spoken with three different representatives in order to get this resolved. It seems that I am just getting passed around and bullied to a point where I feel as if they just want me to be silent and just take whatever they say whenever they feel like responding back to me. 
This was sent to me by their customer service representative. ""When looking at your trip our records show that: A pricing notification screen displayed a dynamic pricing rate of: x x1.3. This rate was accepted: 07:19:58 PM EDT and the other fare in question of $156. 82 was also taken at a time of surge and was at a rate of 2.8x. This fare was accepted at 07:07:57 PM EDT."" 
Uber states that I ""accepted"" this rate at the time of the trip. Both of these trips have starting time of 3am. Telling me I accepted a price 8 hours before my trip is completely insane. This pricing surge was not given to me at the time of my trip. How do you conceive that a trip at 3am was given a surge price and agreed upon 8 hours prior? Not only was this complete lie given to me, I also was sent this information as just a statement and nothing more. Uber, you will NOT bully me into paying for this. Something WILL be done! You may not steal my money and you can bet that I will be sharing this experience.

UBER IS NOT GONNA CARE ABOUT YOU! It left me with option either to go with my insurance or Uber's, with $1000 deductible. And they won't charge the rider even damage fee... There always will be insurance gap, and this is not right! Uber takes $1 riders fee and 20% from the fare, and when our car is damaged, they sit back and sip the drinks! As a 2 year driver I am very disappointed! For riders, they will say the same thing about insurance. In the end, Uber cashes in the money and won't care about anyone when things goes bad!"
